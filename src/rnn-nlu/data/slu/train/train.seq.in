hello , hi , good morning .
this is % uh tour guide one , lynnette .
yes .
okay , i 'm fine .
are you feeling great this morning ?
yes
alright .
is there % um anything that i can help you ?
great .
okay .
and so i did n't get your name just now .
% uh i did n't get your name .
okay .
okay .
yes ?
barcelon ?
okay .
alright .
so i 'll just call you edrelin ?
okay .
yes .
and you were saying that you wanted to come to singapore .
% uh maybe can i have a little bit more details like % uh when will you be coming ?
and like who will you be coming with ?
alright .
alright .
and how old is your son ?
okay .
okay , that 's good .
that 's a very nice birthday gift .
okay .
and how many days will you be % uh spending in singapore ?
okay .
% uh huh .
and is this your first time to singapore ?
okay .
alright .
and has any of your friends or relatives came to singapore before ?
okay , you will be arriving at singapore on the twenty fifth , i guess ?
so that you can spend twenty sixth of august here .
alright .
and % um you will be taking a flight in % uh do you also need me to like advise you how do you get from the airport
and i presume you 'll be staying in a hotel as well ?
okay , and you will probably leave singapore on the twenty seventh ?
okay .
alright .
okay , so % uh what are your son like any theme park or what is he like ?
what does he prefer ?
yes .
% uh okay .
and your husband , does he like % uh
what kind of food does he like then ?
alright .
okay .
like- like chili crabs ?
okay .
% uh yes .
because % uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well .
% um and of course % uh pepper crabs as well .
% uh so i think we- the locals here generally , if we have friends coming over- we like to introduce them to these % uh dishes .
yes .
the hawker food ?
okay .
right .
okay .
and- alright , maybe i can do a recommendation now .
% um okay , if like if you arrived in the airport we have three terminals at the moment .
% um so you probably arrive let 's say terminal one , changi airport .
that 's located on the eastern part of singapore .
and you will be checking in to the hotel .
let 's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel .
% uh that is like about thirty minutes ' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels .
so there are quite a number of hotels there .
so again it depends on your budget .
it 's like one straight road .
and that 's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there .
as well as the % uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt .
okay .
all items-
yes ?
okay .
% uh so i was thinking also maybe % uh since you have only one day in singapore
you could also try taking the subway % uh to your hotel which we call it the mrt .
correct .
so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport , you can go to the subway train station .
you just look for direction .
it 's pretty clear .
% uh you look for the direction that says % uh city train .
and you go down % uh to the train station and you can buy % uh a tourist card .
or- okay , since it 's only one day , i think what you can do is you just buy a standard card .
% uh on this train , it 's actually % uh east-west line .
so this is % um from the east , you 'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station .
so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day
i would recommend that you stay in the % uh city hall .
there are two hotels there for you to choose .
okay .
% uh it 's about in the region of singapore dollars .
% uh three hundred dollars per room .
alright .
% uh not necessary .
you can actually just come in , take the subway to the hotel .
and % uh you can do a one way tour and i will do a few recommendation for you % uh so you do n't have to spend that much money .
yes ?
right .
yes .
yes .
because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about- again depending on the timing that you have arrive , % uh in the region of let 's say forty dollars - singapore dollars .
so all the prices i 'm quoting you will be in singapore dollars .
yes .
okay .
it depends on which % uh particular location that you are going to .
% uh so let 's say we will have to choose .
let 's say now maybe i 'll just talk to you first before i show you the map , the city map .
% uh and also some hotels .
alright .
so it all depends , alright .
the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars % uh to- let 's say three dollars .
but because if you are buying a standard card , there is actually a dollar deposit .
so let 's say if the taxi - the mrt cost one dollar for example , then you will have to put two dollars into the machine .
yah .
so i will suggest that when you are- let 's say your husband is trying to get- % uh retrieve the bags % uh at the conveyor belt .
at the belts .
% uh there are also money changer inside % uh the airport area .
so maybe one can take care of the bags .
% uh the other person will go and change some money first .
some singapore money .
just % uh change a little bit of money just for your meals in the hotel % uh in the hawker centres .
as well as for the ride to the hotel .
alright .
so i estimated .
maybe you can change about singapore dollars , two hundred dollars first .
yah .
% uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation .
just some money to get by for the short while .
you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier .
or if you 're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres % uh there 's always a money changer in the shopping centre .
so you can always change your money there .
yah .
and if you are spending let 's say money in the % uh shopping centre % uh or buying tickets to universal studio , you can always pay them with credit cards .
yah .
yes .
right .
so i mean if you are going to- because it 's a short flight from philippines , so you can arrive in the morning on saturday % uh on the twenty sixth % uh and then you stay overnight the next day .
yah .
or of course if you can have a bit more time , you can arrive prior to twenty sixth , twenty fifth .
and then you leave on the twenty seventh .
yes .
yah .
so you will have like a two night stay in singapore .
okay , from- if you 're taking the subway -
% uh because this is a east-west line % um you will have to change % uh the line in city hall .
% uh so i think better that you reserve forty five minutes .
yah .
it 's pretty frequent .
% uh so of course to be very detailed .
% uh always check with the information counter at the mrt train station .
we call our subway the mrt .
yah .
so there are like certain hotels you can stay .
% uh maybe the landmark hotel over at the- near to the bugis area .
yah .
% um okay .
this is just a normal kind of a hotel .
% uh so they do have % uh quite a lot of family staying in this hotel as well .
% uh yah .
so i do n't think you will require like any special % uh items for the- for your child , right ?
because the whole day you 'll be out .
yah .
yes ?
% uh yah , it 's pretty convenient
because again , you can take the subway .
so what you do is- okay , let 's say we skip the arrival part , right ?
i mean that 's done , right ?
you are quite % uh you know what 's going on from your airport , you take the subway-
to the hotel .
alright .
and % uh so let 's say we start on the twenty sixth .
i 'll begin first , for breakfast .
try some local food .
yes , on the twenty sixth itself .
% uh of course if you want to have the hotel breakfast , you can always- because most of the time , breakfast will be included in your hotel package .
okay .
if you decide not to do it , not to take the hotel breakfast .
i would suggest that you come out from the hotel .
just go across the road .
there is a little % uh coffee shop .
do you take spicy food ?
oh that 's great .
okay .
so what you can do is you just go across the road .
there are small cafes just across your road- the road .
and % uh there is quite a famous i would say % uh roti prata store .
it 's % uh what they serve is like pancake -
but it 's an indian pancake .
yah .
and % uh-
yah .
so you can try that .
and they have another dish called murtabak .
it has all kind of fillings in there ; chicken -
% uh beef , % uh even sardine .
alright .
and they pan fry it .
it 's a dough , they pan fry it .
and you can eat it with your hands just like the locals .
it 's a piece of pancake .
you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry .
but of course if you do n't want , you can always use the spo~ and- oh fork and spoon .
alright .
so you can have that for breakfast , it 's quite a filling dish .
so maybe i 'll suggest that % uh a one piece , it depends on what kind of meat you order .
it ranges from five dollars - singapore dollars onwards .
so you can order just two pieces to try or maybe you can try that .
and you can also % uh do a bee hoon goreng .
it 's like fried % uh noodles .
but it 's malay style .
alright .
so you just order a small- % uh two dish is fine for 3 person .
alright .
quite- big .
yes , it 's quite big .
and you can also have % uh one of our tea .
like a teh tarik kind of a tea .
% um it 's like a pull tea .
tea with milk and they pull the tea .
so you have a lot of foam on your tea .
so that is- this is something very local as well .
yes , so you can have that .
and then you just walk towards the subway % uh which will be the bugis mrt .
it 's about seven minutes ' walk .
and you take the subway % uh to the harbourfront .
okay .
yes , no problem .
% uh majority of us here speaks english % uh because english is our first language and all our sign are all in english .
yes .
so if there 's any % uh problem , you need directions , please feel free to approach anybody that looks like a local .
i think there 's some- yah .
yah , so it 's not a real issue .
% uh okay , the mrt again % uh i would suggest that % uh you take a map of the mrt so that you have a better idea how to travel .
because again % uh from your hotel to the % uh- to harbourfront where you 're going to- i would say that i think you 'll just do universal studio on sentosa on the twenty sixth .
so you will have to change your mrt ride over at dhoby ghaut because that will be the % uh north east line .
yah .
so i think the detailed part , i think we should- you should be able to work it out , right ?
yah .
yes .
% uh okay no . all our mrt , we have this map out there .
we have a map .
okay .
let me try and get you the % uh mrt map .
so there are a few lines okay , from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong .
then we have the north to the south line .
and we have another line , the north east line .
% uh and a circle line .
right now these are % uh the lines that 's available .
so once you get down to the mrt , % uh you will be able to see % uh the map .
okay , i have opened up the % uh mrt lines for you to see .
would you be able- do you- were you- are you able to copy that ?
okay .
alright .
% uh okay .
can you see the east side ?
the green colour line ?
you 're not seeing anything .
% uh would you be able- nothing at all ?
okay .
the- alright , okay .
the changi side is on the east .
it 's on the green line .
okay , can you see now ?
alright .
okay .
can you see the green line ?
okay .
can you see on the right-hand side ?
it says number three changi airport .
alright .
so that is actually the east west line .
so can you follow towards your left-hand side ?
% uh to the left .
and then you- yah , the green line go to the left .
and then you will see city hall .
just go to the left .
okay .
changi , you will see expo .
yes .
and then you will see bedok , kembangan all the rest .
just follow the green line .
okay .
% uh and you will come to bugis .
yes .
yah .
alright .
okay .
so you can stay in this hotel called landmark .
or alternatively , there is another hotel which is very convenient , just lavender .
yes , just before bugis .
yah , there 's another hotel there .
it 's called v hotel .
it 's called a new- v % uh victory .
yeah .
yah .
so you can stay there as well .
it's- i think these two locations are pretty convenient .
at least , you know , you do n't have to change lines .
well from the airport , yes , all the way and v hotel is just directly next to the lavender hotel - % uh mrt .
so once you come out- yah , once you come out the hotel , it 's there .
okay .
yah .
and like i said-
again breakfast time , no issue .
% uh just outside your hotel , there are lots of eating places .
and you can get a breakfast for % uh there 's a food court .
a food court is an air-conditioned % uh it 's a modern version of the non air-conditioned hawker centres .
yah .
so you can choose like if you want % uh just drinks , you want chinese food , you want fried noodles .
so you can do that for your breakfast and then you carry on your tour to sentosa .
alright .
okay , then so- okay , you will have to change your train at % uh city hall .
okay , and after that you will have to change to the red line .
okay , can you see city hall ?
and then you go up .
yah .
and then you see dhoby ghaut ?
just one station .
yes .
okay , and from there , you change to the purple line .
yah .
okay .
purple line .
so you go downwards .
downwards here .
you 'll see clarke quay , chinatown and-
harbourfront .
yah .
so you will alight at harbourfront .
okay .
so i think i will not confuse you with telling you all the cost of the mrt ride .
what you do is when you get down at the mrt , you just- you know , there will be machine .
it 's very easy to operate .
you just press like which direction- which station you are going to .
press harbourfront -
and the machine will tell you how much to pay .
so when you are taking the subway , please remember to take a small singapore money with you .
like a five dollars kind of and a two dollars and some coins .
alright ?
there is change given but they accept the smaller notes .
yah .
so you alight at harbourfront .
okay .
and from harbourfront % uh you can take the cable car -
inside sentosa .
yah .
yes .
the cable car ride % uh i will suggest that you take like % uh one way .
% uh it 's about twelve dollars .
okay ?
per person .
and then once you 're in sentosa -
and also please remember to pack a change of clothes and also like maybe swimming gear as well .
oh okay .
because if you have time , you can go swimming in our beautiful lagoon on sentosa .
yah , and in case , you know , your son play some of the games , he may get wet .
so i think- yah , please bring a change of clothes .
okay huh .
so what you do is like if you are going early in the morning i suggest you go to a short while to the beach .
yah .
and on sen-
yah .
on sentosa itself , you can go on the % uh- okay , i 'll close this % uh mrt % uh map .
and then i will show you the sentosa map .
you can get by using the buses on sentosa .
% uh and the buses that operates on sentosa were- % uh they are free .
alright , they are already included in your fare .
yes , it 's an island just about one kilometre away from the mainland .
% uh it 's on the southern part of singapore .
so i think now you can see the map , the whole map now .
okay .
can you see something blinking in the top left corner ?
okay , and you see % uh tall tower and then there 's something down that has a little bit of u .
okay , can you see my arrow ?
this arrow ?
okay , so you can take the cable car , alright , across .
okay , that is optional .
so let 's see how you- we , you know , oh after you-
i think , yah , that 's a nice ride here .
okay , and on sentosa , you see all these roads ?
okay .
% uh you can travel on the buses- sentosa buses .
okay , and they are colour coded as well .
but % uh again you just look at where you are going to .
so i would suggest that you go to the lagoon .
okay , can you see siloso beach ?
can you see my arrow ?
okay .
so you can do the beach out here for early morning swim .
yes , spend about % uh one hour .
alright .
and then you can go to universal studio .
yes , it 's on sentosa itself .
can you see resort world ?
yah .
so it 's actually over this side .
okay , and of course it 's like a theme park .
so you can see % uh you know , you can basically spend like three quarter of a day or almost a day -
% uh in the park and % uh you can do a lot of attractions there .
% uh you can also buy % uh online before you arrive .
yes .
okay .
% uh a day pass for the adult will cost singapore dollars , sixty six dollars .
% uh and a child will be forty eight dollars .
yah .
okay .
but just to check again , let me see .
the date twenty sixth august , is that a weekday or weekend ?
yes , correct .
so like at weekend , it will be at seventy two dollars for the adult and a child will be fifty two dollars .
okay .
let me just check .
twenty sixth august .
it 's a sunday .
yes .
yah , it 's fine .
it 's just a few dollars difference .
it 's a birthday treat .
right .
yah .
okay .
so you can do % uh- % uh there are quite a few shows there as well .
there are few shows that you can do .
% uh there 's a madagascar , there is this % uh the ride in the movie , transformer .
i think your son will like that .
the ride , transformer .
% uh okay .
yes .
so that is a nice % uh ride to do .
% uh and of course , there are other shows and- i think i will suggest that lunch , you just have a meal in universal studio itself .
because , you know , it takes time to come out and then go in again .
so i 'll just- i will suggest that lunch , you have it in universal studio .
so they have like fast food available .
% uh to local food as well .
% uh so maybe just a quick lunch like a sandwich or something .
and then carry on .
depending on how much % uh your son would like to stay in there .
how much time he wants to spend there , right ?
okay .
so because the % uh universal studio opening hours , it 's from ten a.m. to seven p.m .
yah .
that 's right .
so you could spend like let 's say from ten o'clock , you know , if you go early in the morning for your swim .
or even if you do n't want to swim , just take a walk in the bea- % uh in- around the beach area .
and then you just take a sentosa bus to the universal studio or you can also take the % uh what do you call that ?
the train on sentosa itself .
alright .
% uh those are all included so you do n't have to pay extra money .
% uh then you go to universal studio spend let 's say from ten or ten thirty onwards right up to about five thirty .
or even six .
and then you go for your dinner with the chili crabs .
alright .
so from there , you- again you can take the subway to the clarke quay .
from harbourfront to clarke quay .
okay , there are quite a few restaurants there .
% uh and you can have your chili crabs out there .
right .
yes .
right .
right .
alright , you can go to this place .
% uh again if you 're going to stay in the lavender mrt area .
% uh it 's just like two station away from where you are .
% um you go to funan centre .
yah .
% uh they have all the gadgets out there .
so maybe if you- before you come , you know , you can always check on the prices first .
and % uh because there are so many shops out there that sells similar items , so they are pretty- % uh i would say very attractive prices .
yah .
yah .
yes , so what you- maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount .
% uh but they can always give you freebies because they know that if you go into the shop and you walked out you 'll probably end up buying from someone else .
so it 's quite reputable , the shops there .
so i will recommend like this location so you can do your shopping out there .
and let 's say your- you can leave your husband there for yourself- oh yourself or- i 'm sorry , your husband and your son if your son is interested in a technical product .
then what you do is you walk over to city hall mrt .
and you do your shopping out there .
our shops are open until nine thirty .
because you 're just ten minutes away from one another .
yah .
yah .
yes .
so you have- % uh in the raffles place - % uh sorry , raffles city because it 's just above the city hall mrt .
% uh they have from the branded , alright , like the gucci and everything else .
right up to the midrange products .
so it 's % uh about three three levels of shopping .
and also we have an underground shopping area % uh called citylink .
alright .
so they have all- yes , they have all your shoes , your clothes .
the ladies , the gents .
toiletries , cosmetics , everything is in there .
alright .
it 's different because the quality here % uh is better , i would say .
it 's not like the street kind of % uh shopping .
they are shops .
so the quality is good i would say .
so it all depends .
let 's say if you are buying the branded product , i think here in singapore , we are still relatively affordable .
% uh and % uh if you are buying the midrange products % uh they are in % uh i would say a good condition .
alright .
and on top of that , you can always claim back the gst , the goods and services tax .
which is like % uh seven per cent .
and it 's so easy , you know ?
you- once you arrived back in the airport when you are leaving singapore you just produce the receipt that has been stamped % uh sorry .
% uh that is given by the retailer .
and let 's say if you are putting your purchases in your luggage , so you have that checked by % uh officials before you check in your bags .
alright .
so if you are buying smaller items like % uh jewellery , watches then you can have your % uh gst refund % um just before you board the plane .
once you cleared the immigration , you look out for this sign that says gst and you can claim back your money immediately if you like .
in whatever currency you like .
or you can even charge that back to your card and they will mail back the % uh refund to you when you 're back in the philippines .
yah .
yah , so it 's very convenient .
yes , so i think for one day , you may not have that much time % uh to do your shopping but % uh- so i suggest like let 's say you come out from sentosa about five thirty .
you can have your dinner .
alright .
or you can even % uh let 's say to save time , you can even spe- have your dinner in vivocity .
alright .
because when you 're at universal studio , you take the sentosa train out you 're already at vivocity .
vivo , v i v o .
yah .
so let 's see .
% uh it 's just out of % uh sentosa .
so what you do is when you 're finished with sentosa let 's say i suggest about five thirty , right ?
% uh you just take the sentosa train .
and you will be out in this big shopping centre .
there are lots of restaurants out there - and you can-
okay .
okay .
yes , it 's a shopping mall .
% uh again-
yes .
so if you do n't want to get out of this place , you can also do your shopping out here .
okay .
% uh and % uh- but since your husband wants to do the tech product so i think i would suggest that you have your dinner there .
and then proceed to % uh funan centre .
yah , to get his products .
or alternatively you can do this in the morning % uh before you go on to sentosa island .
so- yah , because the shops will open like % uh ten thirty in the morning .
so you can- for funan % uh about ten thirty , eleven .
so you can go from % uh funan .
do a bit- yes .
so allocate let 's say about one hour-
shopping time for him .
and then you go on to sentosa , let 's say at about % uh in the afternoon .
one o'clock , twelve o'clock .
you 'll be in sentosa .
okay , you can do your lunch again if you are doing funan you can go down to the hawker centre in the basement area .
have your food .
and then go to sentosa .
but then- yah .
okay , i hope you have an idea now how to plan .
okay .
yes .
there is a spa there as well .
% uh so while your kids are enjoying and your husband enjoying their time in universal you can go for your spa .
alright .
it 's outside universal .
yah .
alright .
okay .
or alternatively if your husband is doing his shopping down in funan you can always get your spa done % uh at the % uh nearby % uh hotel area .
there are some spas there as well .
yah .
yah , alright .
yes .
% uh i-
just the full body or just % uh the legs ?
the feet .
okay , approximately about a hundred dollars .
yah .
yes .
okay .
so % um- okay i think tentatively that 's what i can suggest since it 's like a one day programme .
% uh so i hope you got an idea now .
yes ?
okay % uh in singapore we do n't really practice % uh giving of tips but of course if you 're very happy with the service % uh you 're welcome to do so .
but otherwise we % uh do n't have a compulsory tipping but if you 're in the- % uh if you 're having your meals in the restaurants , they do have a service charge there already .
yah , it 's not compulsory .
yah .
okay .
alright .
so thank you .
yah ?
alright .
welcome .
okay .
bye .
hi , good morning .
hi , this is % uh tour guide % uh one my name is lynnette and can i get your name ?
okay .
so can i say about three days ?
okay .
and melissa , % uh when would you be- % uh which period of time are you coming in ?
first week of april , that 's pretty soon , % uh ?
okay .
alright .
so melissa % um in order for me to help you to plan your stay in singapore % uh would you be able to give me some details like how many % uh like who will you be coming with and you know , is there any special thing that you 'd like to do here ?
parasailing .
okay .
alright .
so the- well of course if you can spare five times that would be great but % uh
yah it 's no issue .
i mean three days i could- we could still do everything that % uh you would like to do and % uh i guess your friends the age one would be about twenty to thirty ?
% uh % hm , okay .
and % uh your budget will be in a range of a thousand dollars ?
% uh singa~
the-
so- okay , everything that i quoted here will be in the region of a thousand dollars so that means three person will be three thousand singapore dollars ?
is that correct ?
it 's correct , yah ?
okay , alright .
so % uh because right now- okay , we'll- first of all we will be doing all the things the local people do because you are still young right ,
so you can take the subway to- from the airport to your hotel .
% uh so what i will suggest is the subway is located on the eastern part of singapore in the area called changi and you can take the east-west line .
yah .
yes .
just hold on , % uh-
okay , because i 'm opening up % uh the subway map for you .
okay , can you see the map now ?
the mrt map ?
too small ?
i~
it 's okay now ?
okay .
alright , can you see the number three .
on your right hand side ?
okay .
that 's where changi airport is .
% hm , that 's on the east .
yes , so you 'll see a few colours right ?
so the green line will be the east-west line .
so can you see number two on your left hand side ?
so that is west .
yah .
so i 'm just giving you the green line that is from the east to the west .
okay , and the red line will be the north .
yah .
yah , can you see like % uh woodlands that 's in the north , okay ?
woodlands .
okay , can you see the top-
% uh okay .
and then down will be number ten , can you see number ten ?
right down .
southwest % uh south - towards the south , number ten .
yah , a little bit more .
that 's the maximum , number ten ?
okay .
that-
okay , that 's the north - yes .
that 's the north-south line .
and then we have the purple line .
east-west line % uh sorry , north-east line .
yah .
and then the yellow line .
that 's the circle line .
circle .
circle , yeah .
and % uh this is our latest line .
alright .
so this is the map of our subway .
so it 's fairly easy to get around % uh our % uh sub- by using the subway and you will save like quite a lot of money instead of taking the taxis .
and of course you can always do some sight-seeing while you 're taking the subway , right because % uh away from the centre part of the- of singapore the trains will be running above ground .
yah .
so you actually get to view % uh you know the- some parts % uh of the island % uh and you know if you feel like stopping you can always stop .
that 's where you ha~ yes , correct .
alright .
okay so i will close this map so you have an idea right , how the subway trains run .
yah so what i will suggest is % uh when you arrive singapore you can get a map of the subway trains and it 's just like any other country in the world .
% uh let 's say you are from changi and you want to go to paya lebar .
can you see the junction of the yellow and green line ?
okay , so let say you 're going there .
so what you do is you go to the train station and you will press paya lebar and the machine will tell you how much is the cost .
alright , so you just put in the singapore money accordingly .
so again i 'll suggest that you change some % uh singapore money at the airport .
there 's a money changer inside , before you come out , before you collect your bags there 's a money changer there .
okay .
and when you just come out from % uh the transit area from the airport % uh there are also money changer just immediately outside the % uh % uh the airport area .
alright ?
so you change some money first in order for you to take the subway to get to your hotel , alright .
so try to get some smaller notes like two dollars and five dollars .
lebar .
okay , if you are taking the % um uh- if you are using because you- i think you will be spending a few days so what you can do is you can a buy a % uh- you can buy this % uh a tourist card .
yah .
yes .
correct .
because % uh our standard card , let 's say if the price is a dollar you have to put in two dollars because there is a one dollar deposit and when you leave the station you have to get back your deposit .
yah , because of % uh the cards .
so you must remember to get back your deposit after you exit from the % uh the barrier , alright ?
so like i said since you 're spending a few days you can buy the % uh the tourist card or you can buy this stored value card as well .
yah .
so of course there is also % uh % uh a deposit that 's % uh given to the stored value card .
okay ?
yah , so because we also have like % uh different timing let 's say % uh morning off-peak hours there are certain and it 's slightly cheaper .
so i think-
yah .
so only way to save to- you save quite a lot travelling on the mrt .
so we call our subway the mrt .
% oh , okay .
yah so no issue % uh . so every- all the information are given in english % uh so it 's no problem for you if you 're coming from philippines .
yah .
so and if you need any help just feel free to approach our station % uh our customer service is open .
you know the mrt % uh train station there 's always % uh office , you know you can approach them for help .
% uh no we just have the morning % uh off-peak hours but the rest of the day is the same price .
yah .
yah .
okay , so now once you let say from the hotel - % uh do you have any hotel in mind that you want to stay ?
% hm , alright .
there are quite a number of % uh hotels that you can stay % uh the- i guess you do n't really mind like % uh budget hotels ?
yah .
okay , we have % uh in bencoolen .
okay , it~
bencoolen , it 's near to city hall .
yes we do have .
yah .
s~
so that is like % uh bencoolen hotel , bayview hotel , it 's just in city hall so it 's fairly convenient for you .
so what you do is you take the train , % uh of course you have to get off at expo - % uh tanah merah and then you change to the next train to get down to the- % uh you use back the green line , the east-west line , you alight at city hall .
and from there it 's just about seven to ten minutes ' walk to the hotel .
so and-
okay , so around your hotel there are lot of things to do .
okay , you can try some % uh local food there as well .
yah .
% uh okay i 'm just opening up the bayview hotel .
alright .
it 's just % uh five minutes i would say bras basah to dhoby ghaut station
okay , so you just- even if you do n't want to change station you can actually do a short walk from the city .
yah .
right .
yah .
so % uh from the city hall it 's just about ten minutes i would say to the hotel .
% um of course these are like i would say city hotel so the rooms are not that big .
but i guess you 'll be out of the whole day , right ?
yah .
so just go back and sleep , yah .
so okay , and out there we have very nice % uh % uh museum .
we have the % uh national museum .
okay .
again it 's just walk , alright .
just across from your hotel you can spend easily , you know two hours , i would say minimum one hour in the museum .
yeah .
alright , we have a gallery % uh the history of singapore .
% uh it 's at the back part which is also the newest part of the museum .
% uh you can do- you get a good overview of singapore history from the early- % uh % uh before raffles time right through % uh modern singapore .
so just to do that gallery you need minimum forty five minutes .
yah .
yah because it 's quite a big gallery and it 's very % uh i would say it 's very well planned so you will get a very good overview of singapore history .
yah , if you- yah , and if you have time you can do- we have living galleries % uh on the second level .
% uh we have like fashion , food .
yah so yah % uh- i would say then you go to- if you have time alright our food gallery .
% uh well that will give you an introduction to some of our local food .
alright , so you can do that .
and if your other friends or yourself would like to do some art % uh pieces we have a very good museum just across from the national museum it 's called sam , s a m .
yes sam .
yah , it's- we do n't call it sa~ % uh yah you can call it sam .
% uh it 's actually in full it stands for the singapore arts museum .
yes , alright .
so you can tour another hour out there okay and this museum used to be located in an old school called saint joseph institution .
yah .
so these are the museums that 's taken care of , alright .
and of course if you like some relaxation they have % uh sauna and fitness centre .
alright , in the hotel itself so you can do that .
yah , they have a sauna and a fitness centre .
alright ?
and again , you know if you do n't want to have breakfast in your hotel just outside your hotel there is an air-conditioned food court .
yes , it 's air-conditioned so you have various kind of food like % uh from chinese , malay , indian % uh even philippines food .
yah .
yes .
that is all found in this food court .
you know if you miss % uh food there is one store there as well .
yah .
so- but of course you want to try some local food so i 'll guess that
and one of our local food that % uh a lot of the local likes to do in the morning is we have what we called the kaya toast with coffee .
kaya toast , yah .
so % uh we have this bread with two % uh soft boiled % uh egg .
alright and % um at the bread we will put some kaya which is made of egg , it 's like egg custard .
% uh egg , yah and coconut .
so we call it kaya .
yah and- yes you can have your coffee .
so that 's a very local breakfast .
yes .
so that 's what the local people do for breakfast .
a lot of us-
yah , eat like that .
and then you can go over to do your museums .
alright .
and i would definitely also recommend going to sentosa island .
so you saw the bayview hotel already on the screen ?
okay .
alright so we can go to sentosa .
it 's an island of the southern part of singapore .
yah .
okay and then i think you like % uh swimming as well , right ?
okay .
so you can do like a morning % uh swim .
and since your friend like % uh adventure we have the adventure park .
yah .
okay , so this is something that you saw on the screen .
yes .
yah .
well you can spend like % uh two hours there .
we have the parajump , jungle trip , alright .
okay the prices are all % uh stated there , parajump is like per jump is fifteen dollars .
all the prices i 'm going to quote you will be in singapore dollars .
yah .
and then , yah .
these are something that your friend would be keen to do .
yah .
and then we have the climbmax as well it 's an aerial % uh obstacle .
okay , you saw that on the screen now ?
okay .
so that would be-
yah .
okay .
so i think your friend will enjoy all these .
see , you saw this ?
it 's on the screen now .
yes .
so i think she will get to enjoy herself % um and let say if you or some of your other friends are not interested you can do- so you can separate .
you can- some of them wants to do the adventure go to the adventure the rest were not so adventurous can do sunbathing or just have a swim in our lagoon .
okay , so you can do the beaches .
% uh n~ no , not in sentosa .
yah .
yah .
yes , we have % uh universal studio as well .
yah .
yah this is- you saw universal studio now on the screen ?
okay .
% uh so i will suggest like a whole day trip on sentosa .
yah .
so like your friends want to go adventure park they can do that .
you will spend about one hour , one and a half hours to two hours .
then you go over to universal park .
alright .
so you can see- % uh you can do this- so you 'll probably spend about another half day on % uh universal park .
yah .
% uh it 's not open yet the dolphin thing % uh but the uni~ % uh right now if you want to see the dolphin show it 's in another attraction but on sentosa itself .
alright , and that would be at the underwater world .
so what you do in the underwater world you go inside , it 's located like % uh below the ground area .
and you can go on this travel later that takes you around the whole underwater tank .
and they also have a dolphin show out there .
okay .
so okay you saw the universal now on this screen ?
yah .
so you can buy like a day pass .
yeah .
okay .
it 's cost an adult sixty eight dollars a day .
yah .
and that would be like % uh weekday .
yah , for weekend it will be about seventy two dollars .
just a few dollars more .
alright .
so % uh that 's universal studio , of course lots of things to do there , all the interesting ride like % uh madagascar and they have this transformer ride i think that 's thrilling as well .
okay .
% uh i would say to four hours minimum .
yah .
because if you want to do some of the rides , you know and the show .
so that 's something you can do and let 's say in the evening -
evening you can do % uh- we have actually another show it 's called song of the sea .
% uh it 's a play .
% uh it 's water and laser and fire show .
yah .
so you can do that you know
% uh and then maybe you can have a late dinner .
let 's say you see the show at seven thirty , seven forty and then you come out .
you take the % uh sentosa express it 's a train on sentosa and you can have your dinner over at vivocity .
vivo .
yah .
when you come out of the island it 's on the south , alright .
and it 's just about % uh one km away there 's this big wave like shopping centre called vivocity .
yes , it 's a shopping mall there are lots of restaurants there .
okay and if you do n't like % uh you can go over to clarke quay .
yah .
clarke , c l a r k e next word is q u a y .
yah .
so again there are lot restaurants out there % uh and you can have your meal by the singapore river .
yah and you can have drinks .
alright after your dinner you can have drinks there it is a very popular % uh area for both singaporeans and tourists .
yes .
% uh of course it 's not as hot and % uh people come out to play so it 's nice .
but day time is also alright because at day it will be a little bit quieter
yah .
so there 's a lot of % uh people out in clarke quay .
but it 's not that crowded as in you know it 's so crowded , i mean it 's just % uh nice crowd out there .
yah , you can just go and have drinks and some of the restaurants are in fact in singapore we do n't dress up i would say we dress down .
yes .
yah you do n't really need to % uh dress up .
yah .
alright .
so i 'm actually clipping for you the % uh clarke quay area .
yah you saw ?
you saw the % uh-
yah you saw the restaurants by the bay .
okay .
so there are different % uh % uh restaurants out there .
okay there are so many outlets out there .
there you can see now % uh the shape of clarke quay .
okay the blue part can you see the blue part ?
yah , that is the- yes , that 's the singapore river .
okay .
so you can have your meals - you see all these red , purple all these are restaurants .
okay all these are restaurants here block d , block e , block a , they are all restaurants out there .
yah .
yah .
and of course you must always try our signature- singapore signature 's food right ?
so we-
okay .
you can have our signature chili crab , pepper crab in the seafood restaurants .
yah so do try that and of course with some other dishes % uh the other restaurant 's recommendation but do n't forget to try our signature food .
yah .
% uh no , we have a lot of other food as well it 's just that i think a lot of people % uh know about the % uh chili crabs and pepper crabs because we- % uh the local love this food very much .
and our- and some of our other local food will be like % um % uh fried hokkien noodles
yah .
yah , prawn noodles .
% uh if you like % uh we have fried kway teow as well .
okay % uh otah , things like this okay .
but-
yah , i think .
and april - okay april we still do have- have you ever tried the durian ?
durian , the fruit .
% uh okay .
do you like durian ?
% ah okay , okay .
so yah .
so then i think % uh we will just % uh-
yah the local people like eat- to eat this fruit very much .
the-
yah .
alright , right .
okay .
so i think that 's fine .
i think you can just try our chili crabs and pepper crab and it 's fine to eat with your hands .
even if you are in a restaurant it 's fine you can just use your hands to eat them .
yah .
yes .
yah .
and all the restaurants if you order this dish they always give you a bowl with water and lime or lemon in the water , that 's not for drinking it 's for you to wash your hands .
yah .
yah .
yah just to warn you first , you know that 's not for drinking .
yah .
so you can try- you can do that as well .
and then the first day maybe do it , take it easier , you do a little bit of museum do a bit of shopping around your hotel area .
% uh there 's a shopping mall called city hall .
yah , in city hall there is shopping centre called raffles city .
raffles city .
raffles .
raffles , r a f f l e s .
yah .
so there all the shopping outlets there including mid-range to local brands to % uh the luxury brands .
yah .
% uh and if you are still not tired you can go over to the underground shopping mall called citylink .
yah .
it 's just from city hall .
yah .
yah .
it 's just % uh inside in the basement area .
and from there you can walk to another shopping area called marina square .
yah .
i would say some of them have different % uh outlets out there .
% uh and you can also from % uh your hotel area you go over to our very famous shopping street called orchard road .
you take the mrt .
yah .
yah from dhoby ghaut or bras basah , okay .
% uh and you go to this shopping street called orchard road , it 's just about three stop away from your % uh hotel .
so every other building will be either a shopping mall or a hotel .
yah .
so you can do a bit of shopping and also you can have your meals out there .
yah .
so again all the shopping mall will have a food court .
yes or you can have a coffee or tea % uh in a café in orchard road .
yah .
okay , i 'm just clicking out % uh orchard road now .
okay .
okay , can you see % uh just a picture there on the right hand side ?
it 's just one straight road .
yes .
every other building on the street will be either a shopping mall or a hotel .
yah .
so again you have luxury brand to % uh mid-range to local brands and it 's also fun to just do people watching out there on orchard road .
so again you just can dress casual .
yeah .
yah , so-
% uh you can do like people watching , a bit of shopping , you can do your coffee , tea .
% uh spend about- again yo~ again they all depends , right ?
how much shopping do you want to do % uh let say about two hours .
okay then you do your % uh museum .
okay .
and i think maybe the first day you go for your chili crab at clarke quay that would be better .
okay ?
yah .
so like first day a little bit of walking around % uh and again if you want to do some % uh- yah i think that would be cover some of your first day .
second day set off early- early , alright ?
and then you go for your breakfast a little bit of swim your friend can do all the adventure thing .
alright .
yah .
i will suggest that you do that on the second day .
% uh do a bit of % uh the swim , the adventure park , afternoon you can go for your % uh universal studio .
it close at seven so you can stay till seven and then come out have your dinner .
so you can try a different cuisine now .
% uh first day you can do your chili crab second days , i think most filipino 's like spicy food right ?
yah .
so we have- you can try some indian food , malay food .
yes , we- all our food court we have indian food .
of course there are also restaurants there .
so you can do- because if you 're coming out by seven o'clock then you can come out and have dinner at vivocity .
% um and i guess by then you will finish about nine thirty , ten o'clock then you can proceed home- % uh proceed back to the hotel .
alright .
and third day i would suggest that you go up to our- one of our % uh residential area .
yah , just take the subway .
and you go to an area which is not too far away that is the north line .
yah .
you can go to this area called toa payoh
toa payoh .
yah , t o a .
p a y o h .
no , t a o .
and next word will be payoh .
payoh , p a-
p a y o h .
okay .
% uh you can visit our- just walk around % uh- okay , you just walk around .
it 's quite interesting because you 're right in the heart of our residential area .
yes .
yes . so you take the subway again from this .
yes . so you take the subway again from this .
yah .
and % uh you see how every day how we live .
and- yah .
and what you can do is we have a gallery in this building in toa payoh called hdb gallery .
okay .
okay . can you see now on the screen ?
okay . can you see now on the screen ?
okay .
so it showcase , you can spend about twenty minutes in there just to have an idea of how our public housing is like .
% hm right from the early days in the nineteen sixties % uh to now .
yes yes .
yah . so % uh that 's something you can do .
yah . so % uh that 's something you can do .
alright . so you just need-
alright . so you just need- it 's a small gallery about twenty minutes is sufficient .
and then you can go to a local food centre because there were a lot of little % uh food centres in toa payoh , alright ?
just go to the one that 's fairly crowded .
if you do n't know what to order , just look at what people are eating and just ask them which store they order from .
alright ?
yah , so you 'll get to well % uh interact with our local so it becomes a little bit more interesting .
yah .
and- so you can do that for half day .
okay .
% uh and i guess afternoon you may want to do some spa ?
% uh yah .
or you can do your % uh- again we do have spas around your hotel area , there are quite a few spas located there .
in all the shopping centre there 'll be a spa there .
yah .
right .
yes .
there are also quite a few so you can do that and i think that will cover your second day already .
okay .
and i would say the third day you can visit the botanical gardens .
yah .
so that is located just off % uh orchard road .
yah .
you can easily spend about two hours .
okay you can see now the botanical gardens ?
can you see now ?
okay .
alright , so-
the plants is it ?
no we do have but % uh actually the highlight of the botanical gardens would be % uh the orchids .
orchids .
yes .
orchids , the orchids plants ?
% uh o r c h i d s , orchids .
o r .
c h .
orchids , yes .
so that is actually % uh the highlight of this % uh garden .
see- can you see national orchid garden ?
yes .
and it 's so beautiful out there .
alright ?
and they open early as early as eight thirty in the morning to seven .
so admission for one adult is five dollars .
yah .
yes because every other spot is a picture spot .
okay .
so try to do that in the morning when it 's not so hot .
yah .
and-
just in singapore , okay .
some of the orchids are cultivated here % uh but of course we export our orchids .
in fact singapore is the world third % uh largest exporter of orchids .
yes .
so we have like plants - % uh orchids plants that are specially cultivated here .
yah .
yes .
yes , in the national orchid garden in the singapore botanic gardens .
yah .
and if you are let 's say planning a trip there on a sunday we normally have some free % uh shows in the garden in the evening at six o'clock .
yah .
it all depends % uh we have it % uh once a month in the- just outside the national orchid garden there is like a slope .
% uh so it depends .
it can be a jazz concert , it can be % uh % uh quintet , it can be singing , alright .
yah .
so it all depends on what is available , what is % uh planned for that particular sunday .
and you can always pack your picnic basket with wine and just sit and with your mat , alright .
just sleep or sit over there .
yes .
so that would be the evening time already .
okay then sa~ let 's say if you are doing the morning garden , alright ?
then you can have your lunch again , you know anywhere you like either in orchard road and you can plan a trip to chinatown .
yes because % uh you know traditionally we do have ethnic area in singapore so we have like % uh chinatown , little india and kampong glam .
yah .
so again you can take the subway to go there .
yes .
so-
yes .
% uh it 's actually we have a station called chinatown station .
okay .
otherwise the closest east-west line would be the tanjong pagar .
and you can walk about ten minutes ' walk .
you can visit-
yah .
or you can visit one of our oldest chinese temple called th~
yah , called thian hock keng temple .
% uh yes it 's a buddhist , taoist and confucianism .
okay .
so can you see now the picture of chinatown ?
okay .
yah .
okay , chinatown .
alright , yah .
yah , so you can see this cup of coffee just now ?
okay , the first china town .
yah , these are all old building which has been restored .
so in the old days where the people from all over the world when they came to singapore they like to live in this area which is near the singapore river .
% um and eventually it gets very crowded so people move away from this area and it became just the chinese area .
people ca~ % uh a lot of chinese live here because they work-
% uh i would say there are minority races who live here but majority who were left here were the chinese , they live here .
right .
so in the old days they live on the second floor or third floor , ground floor was used a shop but today we used the ground floor as shops .
second and third level % uh we mainly used them as either a store room or % uh office .
so it 's quite nice to walk around .
yes .
okay this- because in the past there were no air-condition % uh so they- the architects i would say are pretty % uh creative , right ?
they make the big windows which is actually- well we learned from % uh the europeans , alright , % uh to have big windows .
yah , they are influences % uh from europe and when- you see in the past when you open up fully you can get more ventilation into the house .
and right in the centre there 's actually an air well .
yah .
air well that means it 's an open space that goes up to the top of the building and it 's not covered .
because- correct , yah .
so % uh % uh the front is narrow but it 's pretty long so they need to have some ventilation as well as light coming into the house .
% uh so these are the china town houses .
and if you go to china town do look out for this green colour roof that looks like bamboo .
yah .
yah because % uh according to the chinese the bamboos represents % uh long life .
yeah .
so this- yah .
so these are the % uh peculiar % uh features of the chinatown houses .
and also do look out for outside the houses there are engravings like phoenixes , flowers % uh on the outside of the houses .
but it 's just above the green roof on the first level there are usually some engravings out there .
yah .
so it 's nice to walk around .
you can go for foot massage over in chinatown .
you can have a chinese tea appreciation in chinatown as well .
so do spend about one hour if you plan to have your chinese tea appreciation
with some % uh so-called small bites you know like titbits kind of % uh thing .
yeah .
so there are few like % uh chinese tea appreciation % uh places in chinatown itself .
a tea what ?
% oh okay .
okay .
our tea appreciation is not as elaborate as the japanese % uh but our tea if you are going to have your tea in the chinese % uh tea houses the tea comes in- they are being served in small little cups .
so % uh the owners or the server would be able to assist you as to how we drink or appreciate this chinese tea .
yah because you have to go a few rounds .
the first round is to warm up the cups % uh then the first cup where you take is % uh for you to smell the tea and later on you drink this tea .
so you sip , you do n't drink the whole cup .
it 's all very little cups , you know it 's like % uh what the cups would look like the kind of % uh toys when we are small we used to play with this little cups , it looks that small .
yah it is a small cup so it 's actually appreciation .
so you smell it first and then you sip slowly and meanwhile , you know you sort of % uh chit chat with your friends .
so it 's very relaxing % uh in this kind of tea houses .
okay .
and of course at the same time you can order some small % uh % uh bites alright but of course it will be more chinese related kind of % uh food like snacks .
yes .
and of course if you can go to the airport early you can always do shopping out in the airport , your last minute shopping because there 's so many shops in the airport even in the transit area .
okay .
welcome .
okay , your welcome .
alright .
okay , bye .
bye .
hi , good morning .
% uh this is % uh tour guide one .
my name is lynnette .

oh lorraine , sorry .
okay , lorraine .
% uh how can i plan for your trip in singapore ?
% uh huh .
okay .
so like one thousand per person ?
okay .
% uh right now , i think the conversion is one singapore dollars will give you approximately about thirty four pesos .
yah .
so whatever price that i 'm gon na quote you will be all in singapore dollars .
yah .
okay , so it 's there and how many days will you be spending in singapore ?
oh one or two days only yah ?
okay , and is there anything in peculiar that you would like to do here ?

okay .
alright .
% uh what we can do is- one or two days .
alright now % uh you will arrive in changi airport .
alright .
and you can take the subway .
we call ours mrt and i think in philippines , you call it the same as well .
% eh , okay .
% uh all the signs , the street signs will all be written in english .
so you will have no problem % uh getting on the subway or travelling around singapore either by bus or the subway .
yah .
so the subway station and changi airport is called changi airport .
alright .
and you will take the east west line .
it 's the green line .
okay .
% uh if it 's like a one day , you can buy a standard ticket but if it 's for two days , you can % uh either buy a standard ticket or you can buy the tourist ticket .
oh okay , it 's just that the standard % uh- the stored value ticket will be easier for you to travel around but there 's actually a five dollars % uh deposit .
% uh standard ticket , let 's say assuming if the price is like a dollar , you have to prepare two dollars .
at the end of your trip , you just remember to go back to the machine and you 'll be able to get the % uh refund of that one dollar .
yah .
so i 'll just show you in brief % uh the map .
alright .
% uh of % uh of the subway train .
yah , can you see now ?
are you able to see now ?
this is okay .
alright , can you- i think you should be able to see .
okay , so on the right-hand side where you see the number three
that is changi airport .
yes , the green line .
you have to get off the train at expo .
and you will continue with the green line .
okay .
% uh and i guess the- age-wise % uh you 're between twenty to thirties .
alright .
you can get off at- there are few hotels that you can choose from .
okay , that is % uh one of- well , it 's quite a new hotel now called v hotel .
v as in victory ?
yah .
new hotel .
it 's at lavender mrt .
okay , so that 's one hotel that you can choose .
the next hotel will be at bugis .
the next station .
% uh that 's called landmark hotel .
yah .
and then if you go to the yellow line , just follow the green line up-
the yellow line .
that 's another word called bras basah .
okay .
there 's another hotel there called the % uh % uh bayview hotel .
okay .
so these are all % uh budget range hotel .
but i will chose these view hotels because they are very convenient in terms of % uh walking .
to your- the places of interest .
% uh best-
best as in ?
alright .
okay .
% uh the three hotels , they do have % um breakfast , they have % uh fitness centre and also they have swimming pool % uh and sauna as well .
alright .
so i would say that they are fairly % uh compatible .
compatible .
% uh but the one at lavender , that would be quite a new hotel because they have just opened recently .
alright .
okay .
but if you want to be like very near to the main shopping area walk to the museum -
then i would say that the one closer to bras basah would be better .
okay .
so % uh that would be the bayview hotel .
okay .
you just cross like the first day , you can do a museum tour .
okay , just cross across from the hotel and you are at the national % uh museum of singapore .
alright .
yes , you just need to walk .
alright .
so what you do is you just walk you can spend easily .
alright , few hours in the museum .
% uh but i would say a minimum stay of one hour to two hours .
yah .
so you go in to the newest part of the museum .
and- alright % um okay .
this is our museum area .
you can see on the left-hand side , this glass area .
okay .
you go in from the older part of the museum , you go into the newer part of the museum .
but inside this gallery-
inside this gallery itself , you 'll be able to learn about the history of singapore right through from the early nine hundreds to modern day singapore .
% hm you can use the audio guide .
we have- we do provide audio guides for you .
so do remember to % uh check out the audio guides .
alright .
so it 's self-explanatory .
and you can do like % uh a one hour inside this history gallery .
yes , it 's in english .
yes , in english .
so you can do this % um % uh tour .
alright .
and if you have time , you go back to the older part of the museum .
we have living galleries in there .
but if you do n't have , then that 's fine .
just cover the history part .
okay .
now after this , so you can do this in the morning .
okay , have your lunch in our many hawker centre .
okay , there 's just one just outside your hotel area .
okay , they have various kinds of food .
like chinese food , indian food , malay food and we even have fish and chips out in our hawker centre .
now , one meal % uh will cost you with drinks in the range of eight singapore dollars .
so that means like if you have rice with three dishes % uh and a drink .
yah , that 's approximately about eight dollars .
alright ?
yah .
then from there , you can take the mrt -
to % uh chinatown .
yah .
okay , because you would have a good idea of the history of singapore .
generally people came here from all over the world
% uh because they were looking for jobs out here-
in the early days .
% uh so the chinese came , the malays from nearby , the malay archipelago .
% uh the indians from southern part of india .
the arabs .
% uh okay .
and the europeans of course , they came and-
in the beginning , all of them live in this place called chinatown .
alright .
but eventually it gets crowded so the % uh they moved away from this area .
so the chinese stayed back in chinatown .
then the malays moved to this area called kampong glam .
and the indians moved to this area called little india .
yes , so what we have done is we have preserved all these ethnic areas .
yes , so you can actually do chinatown first in the afternoon .
that means you can also have your lunch % uh in chinatown .
there 's also a non-air conditioned food court % uh in chinatown itself .
okay .
so you alight at chinatown mrt train station .
% um there are some other cafes there as well if you want to do your cafes .
walk around chinatown .
okay , so appreciate the architecture .
pick up a bit of % uh souvenirs from chinatown area .
okay .
okay % uh not in april .
we do have a big festival in chinatown .
that would be in % uh january period .
yes .
but it 's okay , it 's still very % um % uh a nice walk around chinatown because the houses there are preserved .
alright , they are under conservation status .
so the front part of the buildings are all preserved already .
so-
okay .
yah .
there are- yah % uh , i would say we also learnt from the europeans
because you will see big windows
which allows air to ventilate the whole area .
yah , because in the old days , their houses were not air conditioned .
alright .
so % uh you can actually see % uh % uh okay , that 's another view of chinatown .
alright .
oh .
yes .
so % uh you can visit this- on the right-hand side , there 's a buddha relic hotel % uh temple .
it 's a chinese temple .
okay .
% uh right .
can you see chinatown visitor centre ?
you can pay a visit to this chinatown centre .
and again , if you like to really learn more about the people in chinatown , how- what kind of conditions they were living in .
% uh just about two street away , there is a chinatown heritage centre .
so you can visit there as well and to see how people- in the past , they lived in this very cram condition in chinatown .
so like one house will be divided into various cubicles and you can have easily % uh- fifty people living in just one house on one level .
yes , so that 's something very % uh unique i would say .
% uh of course we do n't live like this anymore but this was how the % uh poor people , the coolies , the labourers , the rickshaw riders they used to live in chinatown .
alright .
yah , it 's no problem .
this buddha relic temple is open to the public .
% uh just make sure that you are % uh dressed properly .
like % uh no short skirt , no shorts .
% uh if you are wearing culotte just you know , have it like % uh touching the knee , below the knee .
if you are wearing like t-shirt , try to be get % uh wear a t-shirt that has sleeve and you 'll be fine .
okay .
% uh if you are- if you should really want to wear short , it 's still fine .
because at the front of the buddha relic temple , they do provide scarfs for you to put on .
% uh but i would say dressing-wise as in any other place of worship just % uh this would be % uh good enough .
alright .
yah .
and just down the road % uh i think we can do that just % uh buddha relic temple .
but if you really want to see another chinese temple , then you have to walk to the % uh temple called thian hock keng temple .
that 's about % uh fifteen minutes walk away from here .
yah .
so you can do this .
alright .
do a little bit of lunch .
a bit of souvenir shopping .
appreciate the architecture because the architecture here would be different from the ones in kampong glam and little india .
% uh so do look up .
you know you- i think you can see just above the flowers , there are this green coloured roof % uh that looks like bamboo plants .
okay , so this is- the architecture would be different from the houses in kampong glam and little india .
% uh no . the difference % uh- it just looks like % uh bamboo plants , they are made of ceramic .
alright .
% uh and because the chinese- according to the chinese , the bamboos represents % uh bamboo .
alright , look- they look bamboo and according to the chinese , bamboo means everlasting or long life .
yah .
no , this is % uh- % uh no . they are not real bamboos .
they are made of ceramic tiles .
% uh it 's just that they are made to look like bamboos .
so the bamboos according to the chinese are auspicious % uh symbol .
okay , so you will don't- you will not see this kind of roof over in kampong glam and little india .
alright .
okay , so after your walk in chinatown , i could guess that would be about two p.m .
you can go over to % uh little india .
yah .
so you take the subway train again that happens to be the correct line .
so you will alight at % uh little india .
okay .
and again , it 's very straightforward , the main road of little india is serangoon road .
serangoon , i 'll spell it for you .
s e r-
a n g o o n .
yes , serangoon .
yes , correct .
okay , so it 's just one main street .
and out of this main street , you can go to the little streets .
so if you are lost , you just go back to the main street again .
yah .
so- yes , when you get up from the chinatown .
chinatown , same station , you take the same line and you alight at little india .
okay .
so you will alight at the station called little india .
when you come out of the station - but just remember that most of our subway or rather all our subway train station have a few exit .
you just come out to the exit that is towards % uh little india % uh arcade .
yah , with signage .
yes .
right .
in all- yes .
in all our mrt train station , there 's always a station master .
so % uh you just approach % uh the station master and anyway the signs are all quite clear .
so just alight- % uh i mean just come out from the right side of the mrt train station .
okay .
and then at the % uh- so the main area will be what we call the little india arcade .
it 's not a games arcade .
it 's just so-called the little india arcade .
okay , then you can do a walk because it's- the whole atmosphere is totally different from chinatown .
you will see quite a few flower garland shop .
% uh because the indians % uh like flowers because it represents the way of life .
and of course they use- % uh they buy- the indians buy them or rather the hindus % uh they buy them and offer the flower garlands to % uh their gods when they go to visit the % uh temples .
alright .
okay .
so- yes , so you can- you will see like flower garland shop .
you will see % um shops selling vegetables .
vegetables .
like a market but they are like stand alone shops .
% uh they do have a market .
% uh if you go back to- now i 'm still showing the chinatown .
i 'm still showing the chinatown visitor % uh complex .
just on the left hand side , there is a food centre .
in the basement of the food centre is a market .
okay , but % uh- so it 's like a wet market .
a wet market , it means the floor is perpetually wet .
so they sell meat , vegetable , fruits , flowers , everything is sold there .
but that close at twelve p.m .
alright .
so % uh if you want to do a market , you can do that .
and then take a trip to little india .
okay .
so take a trip on the subway to little india .
now in little india , the houses are a little bit different .
like i mentioned , you will not see % uh houses with this green roof .
the houses in little india will be a little bit more simpler in design .
compared to the ones in chinatown .
yah .
so % uh take a walk around % uh little india and % uh soak in the atmosphere out there .
the sari shop .
very colourful sari shop .
and of course do try the indian pancake called % uh roti prata .
okay .
there 's also north indian food called chapati .
your eating in little india , it 's not very expensive .
% uh about eighty cents for a piece of plain roti prata .
yah .
and you can also have this bread called naan .
or you can have chapati which is made from wheat flour .
okay .
alright .
so you can eat with your hands .
if you eating this kind of food -
okay , nobody will give you funny looks .
alright .
and % uh of course if you want to buy some sari-
the cheapest one would be in the range that 's made of poster would be in the range of singapore dollars , ten dollars .
and you can wear with % uh short % uh blouse .
alright .
okay , so this is % uh
if you can see on the map , can you see the word serangoon road on the right-hand side ?
yah .
you can see % uh- so that is the whole- the main road of % uh little india .
then you can see all the little road that leads out from serangoon road .
okay .
so you will be doing % um- can you see the word campbell lane ?
okay .
oh % uh there is this- a lot of activities can be found over there .
you can do % uh henna painting on your hands .
% uh the you know , when you first apply , it were- it 's black in colour but it takes about half an hour to dry .
when it starts to crack , you will just scrape off .
leave this orange % uh a stain on your hands , it probably last you about seven days .
okay .
so the indians lady do the henna painting like right now for special occasions when they get married for special % uh festival but otherwise you can do henna painting any time .
% uh no , they do have- % uh traditionally of course it 's just % uh flowers or geometric design .
flowers mainly .
so they do have % uh patterns for you to choose .
yah , the artist are pretty good .
they can just come out .
they can draw for you within like % uh less than five minutes and they are done .
okay .
and you get about % uh- okay , i just want to show you some of the scene-
in chinatown % uh in little india , this one here .
okay .
and the next one is food .
do you like colourful food ?
okay .
% uh one of the typical indian food is called indian rojak .
rojak will be- that means like everything mixed together .
so you can choose what you like % uh from potatoes to egg , to meat .
yes so you choose what you like .
% uh that they are usually quite colourful and they serve you in this orange looking % uh sauce .
and the next one will be the flower garland shop that i just talked about .
okay .
no , not really .
okay , like the % um % uh indian rojak for example .
% uh the sauce is not that spicy .
just a little bit spicy but if you do n't like spicy food , you can actually skip the sauce .
% uh for the naan , of course it 's not spicy , it 's made of % uh wheat flour .
roti prata , they are all made of flour .
and if you again do n't like spicy food , then you skip the % uh curry .
well some of our younger children , they do eat roti prata with sugar but that 's not very traditional .
yah .
or if you again don't- you do n't like spicy food , is it ?
okay .
so you can also have your roti prata or your chapati with dhal .
okay , it 's a sauce called dhal .
it 's made from beans so it 's not spicy .
yes .
so instead of getting curry , you ask for dhal .
alright .
okay .
dhal , yah .
and % uh that 's also a typical food in little india .
yah , i think these are quite typical food already in little india .
okay , and you can have a drink -
called lassi , l a s s i .
it's- it is taste a little bit like yogurt .
taste a little bit like yogurt .
okay , but- okay , it 's made up of yogurt .
alright .
% uh but they have added in like the modern % uh taste would be- you can have mango lassi .
alright .
there are all the different kind of fruits % uh that 's added into this % uh yogurt drink .
so it 's a typical- yah , it 's a typical indian drink .
right .
okay .
so a meal in % uh food centre would cost you about- with the % uh lassi .
about eight dollars .
okay .
now , so you can walk around little india , i gave you a few images for you to see .
and then you can go on to do kampong glam .
yah .
so remember earlier on i said about the different races that used to live in singapore and later it was so crowded , they all moved away to different parts of singapore .
so if you 're really done your museum tour , that will be a good way to see % uh you know , how the people you % uh live in these different areas .
okay , so the people in little india , in the past they used to engage in cattle related activities .
like % uh milking of cows .
so again if you look at the map , there are roads named after buffalos .
right , there 's a buffalo road .
okay , there is- if you walk- look up a bit , it 's called- there 's another road called kerbau road .
that 's also named after buffalos or cows .
that 's malay , but- okay ?
so from our street names , you can actually tell what kind of activities , people in the past used to engage in .
alright .
so you walk a little bit down serangoon road , you will come to this % uh sri veeramakaliamman temple .
yah .
so from there % uh in the afternoon , the- in the afternoon , the temple is closed but you still can get good photograph of the exterior part of the temple .
take some good pictures .
and then you just walk to farrer park , just walk straight .
again , you 'll come to the mrt called farrer park mrt .
and then take a train to kampong glam but you have to change train .
alright .
so % uh if you are not too tired .
alright .
so otherwise you can reserve kampong glam for the next day .
because you 'll be doing chinatown , little india in the first day .
so like some of the other souvenirs that you may want to pick up in little india would be like bangles .
you can buy bangles for a dollar each .
for a dollar of % uh a dollar for a few of these plastic bangles .
sari if it 's not too elaborate about singapore dollars , ten dollars onwards .
yah .
so some shop here they get your henna painting done .
yah , so that 's about five dollars .
for one hand , yah .
okay .
so these are the things you want to do then you proceed on either the same day or the next day you go to kampong glam .
okay , you try to reach the- let 's say % uh- it 's still very busy i would say in the night time because there are lot of nice cafe out there .
okay .
% uh , no night market in kampong glam but there are a lot of cafes and of course the highlight would be the sultan mosque .
okay .
okay , it 's a mosque so % uh again you have to be appropriately dressed-
for a visit to the mosque .
% uh but again if you want to visit the mosque , you try to time your timing let 's say before 4:30 .
alright .
so you can visit the mosque but just before the prayer hall .
okay , so have a look , it 's a bit different from churches , you do n't see chairs inside the prayer hall .
% uh have a look , alright ?
and then just outside the mosque , there 's a street , it 's a walking- a pedestrian mall called the bussorah mall .
alright .
some of the- again like the architecture , take a look , it 's quite different from the little india as well as chinatown houses .
there are subtle differences .
no , they are all traditional and conservation houses .
alright , so we have % uh seen little india , right ?
now , proceed to kampong glam .
i would say subtle differences .
subtle differences .
okay , now yes .
you are actually seeing % um a white house , this used to be the sultan palace but they are now undergoing % uh restoration .
alright .
so % uh glam is actually named after a tree by the name of the glam tree .
they used to grow abundantly around this area because they used to be % uh just next to the sea .
% hm so the boats , when they come here for trading , they stop there .
and these trees are pretty useful like if there 's a small leak on the boat they can use % uh the bark of the tree to repair the small little hole .
% uh the leaves can be used to make medicine and the bark- the fibres of the tree can be used to make baskets .
alright .
yah , we do n't get to see a lot of this tree but they are still available .
okay , so i 'll see- i 'll show you now a map of % uh kampong glam .
okay , but you do n't need to do the whole thing .
you can just do the small part , alright .
it 's because it 's just- if you have ony one hour , that 's still fine .
so you just walk around this certain street and i like to introduce you to- if you remember the white building that i showed you , that 's % uh the sultan palace .
okay , just on outside , there 's a street called kandahar street .
okay .
% uh and this street has beautiful architecture .
okay .
so okay and just spend a bit of time , just outside the mosque , there 's a bussorah % uh mall .
you can pick up some traditional games and i think you have played them before possibly when you were young like five stone .
% uh so some of these traditional games % uh you can pick them up .
the- it 's like about a dollar each for these kind of toys .
and then you can walk to % um % uh haji lane .
they are just one street away from each other .
and you can have your dinner there .
so we have like mediterranean food .
so % uh i would say sorry % uh mid-eastern kind of % uh food .
% uh so you can just pick whichever cafes that you like .
yah .
yah , and then you can have drinks and you can even try this % uh shisha .
it 's water pipes .
which are very popular in the arab countries .
yah .
so these are some interesting things that you want to do .
and of course if you want to try out belly dancing as well .
yah .
so you can also do that in kampong glam .
yah .
yah , you can watch their performance .
you can join them or you can even take a short course on belly dancing .
okay .
so these are the things you want to do like either the whole day or you can reserve next day for % uh kampong glam .
okay .
so i think % uh that 's about what you can do within one to two days , right ?
and of course do n't forget a little bit of % uh shopping or people watching in orchard road .
because you are just staying very near .
% uh just one to two station away from orchard road .
okay , and then of course we have the gst , the seven percent % uh tax rebate .
if you buy above a hundred dollars from the same shop .
and which has this sign that says the gst .
like small little shops , they will not be gst % uh registered so you wo n't get back your tax refund .
no , what you do is let 's say you are buying from a big shop , right ?
so % uh you just tell them you want a gst form , they will give it to you .
you just fill it up at the airport when you 're leaving singapore .
just make sure that you get it stamped .
% uh and- when once you clear the immigration , you can get back your money-
in whatever currency you want .
yah , the bigger shop that has this gst sign .
the small little shops , they will not be gst % uh registered so they will not be able to % uh give you the gst form .
okay .
okay .
% uh what we can do is because we do n't have like fine sand in our % uh- on the mainland .
% uh the nicer beach will be on sentosa island .
otherwise you- if you do n't want , we have a beach that- if you do n't have to go the sentosa island , then it will be on the east coast .
okay , you can take the % uh subway train .
% uh or you can take bus thirty six .
alright , to go to the east coast area .
% uh and just have a sunbathe and just relax or just have a little bit of swim .
% uh bring a picnic basket % uh to the east coast .
right .
and it 's also quite close to the airport .
yah .
yah but it maybe a bit troublesome , right ?
because you have to bring your luggage and all that there .
okay , so i suggest that if you still have time , you know like the second day , just relax and then come back , pick up your luggage and then go to the airport .
the what ?
the spa in east coast - % uh not in the east coast area , they do n't have the spa out there .
so our spa will be found mainly % uh in the shopping centre .
and the hotels .
some of the hotels do offer spa .
alright .
so i hope i had been helpful to you .
sorry , you ?
% uh okay , we have the different % uh festivals that 's celebrated in singapore .
but % uh if you are coming in april okay .
april , we do n't have a major festival .
in the month of april .
okay , we have % uh depending on the year % uh chinese new year , usually january where we have this major festival in chinatown .
% uh september would be the mooncake festival .
hari raya , some time in august .
and deepavali was be some time in october .
the event would be-
you will see a lot of shops selling this cake that is round .
it looks like the moon .
okay , so this is celebrated by the chinese people .
it 's appreciation of the moon , i would say , this festival .
yah , there are of course legends associated with this mooncake festival .
yes , it 's actually % uh mooncake and together it 's the lantern festival .
so we will eat mooncake , the children will carry lanterns .
% uh and just walk around where they live .
yah , we do have like in our housing estate , the children can actually walk around with a lantern but otherwise it 's only for a particular day .
it should be somewhere in september .
yah , but- yah , but anyway throughout this whole month , you 'll see a lot of shop selling this mooncake .
a lot of shops will be selling the lanterns % uh as well .
so you get this % uh mooncake % uh kind of festival mood throughout the whole month .
yah .
parade of buddha .
% uh no . usually the mooncake % uh we just have mooncakes to eat and the children will carry or even the adults carry lanterns % uh that 's about it for the lantern festival .
okay .
alright .
okay , this is % uh not like a nationwide festival .
okay , you know , the chinese have so many different gods .
so this is just a festival that is celebrated .
we have a temple in- somewhere in the eastern part of singapore .
yah % uh so basically it 's one of these gods % uh % uh festival , that 's about it .
so the chinese will offer food and offering % uh to the gods .
food and offering .
yah , that 's right for the particular god 's birthday .
% uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore , then yes , they are- it 's quite % uh festive .
you 'll see a lot of people offering prayers .
% uh otherwise it is not like a nationwide kind of % uh festival .
the major festival would be like chinese new year .
deepavali , hari raya and christmas eve .
that 's our major festival .
chinese new year , if you are down in january feb- % uh january period .
% uh again very festival-like because we have a lot more shop selling chinese new year cookies % uh decorations so it 's a very kind of a festive mood .
% uh yah .
then hari raya would be again very festive but it will be either in kampong glam or another area called geylang .
again , people are selling food associated with the celebration of hari raya .
% uh people are buying new clothes .
% uh for the whole family to wear when they visit one another .
% uh deepavali , quite similar to the other two festivals .
and of course christmas time in december , we decorate all the buildings along orchard road right up to the marina square .
i think % uh- % uh chinese new year , hari raya , deepavali and christmas , that 's where everybody celebrate .
yah .
okay .
so % um september , we do n't really have a ma- % uh sorry , april , we do n't really have a major festival but % uh good friday , it 's % uh our pub- one of our public holidays here .
summer day .
% uh we do n't have a summer day but because % uh well , we are in the equator so it 's summer throughout the whole year .
% uh no major festival like i said in % uh april .
so % uh but otherwise it 's still busy .
alright , we are still busy and we still have a lot of tourist coming in throughout the whole year .
so you still get this very festival % uh mood in singapore .
yah .
okay , bye .
okay , bye .
hi , good afternoon .
hi % uh this is % uh tour guide one
% uh and my name is lynnette .
hi lorena .
hello .
okay sure , and % uh when do you plan to come to singapore ?
okay , just for two days ?
and % uh would you be coming with any other people ?
okay .
% hm okay .
so it 's a birthday treat .
alright .
is there-
and how many days were you be spending here ?
okay .
and is there anything in particular that your husband would like to see ?
number one ?
% uh right now i would say sentosa .
does he like to see % uh wildlife as well ?
% ah okay .
okay .
and does he like a little bit of relaxation or more adventure ?
right , okay .
so % uh what you can do is- because just now you also mentioned to % uh look around singapore ?
so what i will suggest is % uh the first day you could do a little bit of sightseeing and % uh also include either our zoo and night safari for first day and second day sentosa .
% uh third day with a little bit of shopping % um and relaxation .
how does that sound to you ?
okay .
% uh i think it 's quite fine with a thousand dollars it 's actually quite fine .
you can actually make do with that % uh in singapore .
and % uh coming in from the airport % uh
do you have any % uh hotel in mind ?
not at all ?
right .
okay % uh there are quite a number of places that you can stay
% uh and it 's quite easy to get around using the subway trains we call it the mrt out here .
so that is- % uh the mrt from changi is on the east , it is a green line .
and % um it is fairly easy .
% uh you buy a standard ticket .
so you just look for the place that you are % uh- that the location that you will be alighting and then the price will be flashed on the screen and you just pay accordingly .
so what i will suggest is % uh change some singapore money at the airport either inside the transit hall or just outside after your collection of the bags there are money changer there .
so you just change some small singapore money like % uh a dollar coins , two dollars notes and five dollars note to help- just to % uh- for your travelling needs on the subway and to try out some local food .
yes almost anywhere in singapore .
yah .
so we have like % uh from changi airport is the east to the west line .
so if you take all the way you come to the west that 's jurong .
then we have another line , the red colour line that 's north to the south or south to the north line .
and then we have a purple line % uh that goes from the % uh- % uh that goes from the north-east line .
yes .
right .
% uh no .
% uh can you see the map now on the % uh internet ?
okay , just give me a minute .
right , okay .
i think you should get it very soon in the next few seconds .
okay , can you see number three on your right hand side ?
okay .
and the ne~ % uh-
you move to the left you see expo ?
alright .
so you have to change your train from here .
right .
and % uh- so you have to change your train at tanah merah .
yah from tanah merah you follow the green line all the way down .
okay .
and can you see a crossing between the red and the green line ?
right .
that 's city hall , yah .
so that is actually one of the terminal station , % uh you can change line from here .
okay .
now- yah .
yes .
yes .
and actually if you go back to tanah merah you go to the left you will see paya lebar .
okay .
that is also another line that you can change , it 's to the yellow line or if you move up a little bit to the purple line .
can you see the crisscross between yellow and green ?
yah , and then you- yes .
and then you move up you will be able to see serangoon across between yellow and purple .
yes .
so this are like- once you see an intersection % uh with these two round circle , these are % uh stations that you can change line .
okay .
and if you are moving from changi that 's to the- you 're in the east .
so let 's say you 're going to take somewhere to bugis if you move to the left .
alright .
% uh then you just go to the direction to bugis .
yah .
yes .
alright .
okay now can you look to the red line ?
can you find the red line towards the north ?
okay .
can you find- % uh there 's a intercross- intersection between the red and yellow ?
yes .
then you move up- yes , you move up a little bit to ang mo kio .
% uh it 's not in ang mo kio from there you have to change a bus to go to the zoo and night safari .
okay , let me- okay , you are just going to the night safari park , right ?
okay , let me just show you- alright , can you see now ?
alright , you got it ?
it 's up now , % uh . okay .
alright .
the night safari park opens from seven thirty to twelve midnight .
and the admission cost is thirty two dollars for an adult .
yes .
so basically you will be doing a tram ride .
and on the tram ride you will be able to see more than seventy per cent of the- what the night safari has to offer and there are a few walking tours that you can do on the night safari park .
% uh you 'll be riding as in , in the park you mean ?
yes , on the tram because % uh the western loop of the night safari you ca n't walk so you will have to- i would suggest that you take % uh a tram ride midway .
can you see the leopard now ?
just now .
okay .
there is a stop at the % uh leopard % uh trail .
so you could get off the leopard trail , do a half an hour walk and then come back to the same tram station to board back the next tram ride and that will bring you back to the entrance .
so this ride itself excluding the walk is about forty minutes .
just on the tram , yah .
it 's a slow ride and you can see the animals very up-close .
for example-
yes , quite close .
% uh no because they are wild animals .
they are not like % uh trained so it 's just that they live in this protected park .
so please do not stretch out your hands or any part of your body .
yes .
okay , in the- alright .
in the afternoon you could either do % uh the zoo % uh as well because they are all- they are just located % uh next door to one another and you are looking at different animals .
yes , they are just next door to one another so it 's totally different .
so you are seeing- in the zoo you 'll be seeing more mammals % uh like the orang-utan , the chimpanzee .
% uh for the night safari it will be more of the nocturnal creatures like the % uh % uh tigers , the leopards % uh basically animals that hunt in the night time .
yah .
so this is something that you may want to consider .
% uh otherwise on the first day % uh you could also do a little bit of % uh sightseeing around singapore % uh going to the ethnic areas of singapore .
so you could do a little bit of the % uh chinatown area , alright .
% uh you could also do a little bit of the kampong glam and little india in the morning the whole day , alright ?
then in the night you can take % uh all these % uh places that i 've mentioned
are accessible on the mrt except that you may have to just to change trains but like i mentioned it 's fairly easy to get around .
yah , we do have quite a lot of the % uh bars .
% uh so maybe the first day you could do that and % uh if let 's say after your % uh night safari and you 're not too tired you can bring your husband , yourself relax % uh- i would like to recommend you the clarke quay area or boat quay area , that 's in the southern part of singapore .
okay .
basically there are a lot of bars there so you could have a drink .
% uh and of course i 'd like to recommend you- % um specially concocted in singapore it 's called the singapore gin sling .
% uh that is something % uh one of our signature drink that you can get in any of the bars .
% uh but of course if you like something very traditional
then it will be at the raffles hotel the long bar over at the raffles hotel .
that 's also on the southern part of singapore .
best drink .
% uh i would say other drinks other than liquor some traditional drinks % uh bubble tea where we can get from small bubble tea shops .
% uh the indian drink will be lassi % uh the malay drinks would teh tarik .
okay , norm~
normally it 's a tinge of sweetness .
so it 's tea % uh mixed with a lot of different kind of % uh fruits but it is not % um- it doesn't- it 's not as thick as a smoothie .
% uh yah .
so these are the other drinks that we have % uh other than cocktail drinks or wine .
yes .
so you can get this bubble tea from a lot of counters % uh and they are usually counters located in shopping % uh complex .
% uh you would be able to find one such store otherwise in some of our food centres you maybe a to~
me~ you may be able to find them as well .
i guess we do have a lot of convenient stores .
% um the local chain would be like cheers , c h e e r s . it 's a small convenient store .
okay otherwise % uh every other % uh let 's say front of some shopping centres you will also find little cafés .
% uh are you talking about like to get snacks and drink ?
okay .
alright .
so yes , one of the local ones would be like cheers % um and then we have like supermarket , there is always one in % uh the major shopping centres , there is always a supermarket .
so we have % uh the local chain would be ntuc , % uh cold storage , shop n save .
% uh these are the kind of % uh i would say supermarket and you can always find one % uh of this supermarket in % uh the shopping centres .
so you can always get your drinks , your snacks basically do even marketing .
alright , lots of them .
% uh major shopping centres located at the orchard belt area .
% uh so orchard road it 's one straight road .
so again if you remember correctly if you take the green line to the left and then to city hall there 's a big shopping centre there called raffles city .
beneath the road there is citylink .
and if you take another few stops away % uh that 's to orchard road mrt train station .
% uh on that same stretch of road there are lots and lots of shopping centre .
well i would say that singapore is one city but it is a place where a lot of the locals , the tourists go there for people watching , % uh do a bit of shopping as well as have tea , dinners , lunch .
it 's a place where you can do a lot of things out there .
right .
% ah okay .
it 's % um- actually this street name is actually named after the street before we developed into orchard road used to be a plantation , orchard plantation that 's how this street gets its name .
% uh so like some of the major shopping centre would be % um tangs studio , tangs , % uh ngee ann city which is a huge shopping complex .
ion , it 's % uh one of the latest addition % uh nice shopping centre .
% uh just all across one another and next to one another .
right .
okay .
let me- yes , okay .
alright .
okay % uh i 'm actually giving you the map now .
okay , can you see % uh this shopping centre on top is called ion ?
okay , this is- yah .
then you can see some of the street scene , okay .
and i will also give you the map now .
okay , i 'm giving you the map now .
yah .
so- okay , this is one whole- okay , can you see this yellow box thing somewhere around number ten ?
yes correct .
number fifteen , number ten the square yellow thing .
alright .
okay , this is like the beginning of orchard belt .
okay , this whole street .
so you see all the blue buildings they are all % uh hotels or shopping complexes .
yah .
shopping .
yes correct .
so these are all shopping .
so all the blue buildings are either shops or- i mean shopping mall or hotels .
right .
forty- yah , okay .
so you could actually spend the whole day there if you want to .
yah so % uh the shopping hours in singapore % uh starts at ten o'clock finish at-
ten a.m . and finish at nine thirty .
well you have the- yah .
alright .
% uh we have of course the luxury brands % uh gucci , coach , prada .
they are located in most of these shopping centres like number thirty , twenty two ion we have them .
and then you move on to twenty seven that is paragon , right .
so these are the major brands can be found here .
and of course twenty three as well .
okay and number twenty six , okay .
so these are the luxury brands that you can find % uh usually on the first level .
% uh on the basement area and upper floors % uh you can get the mid-range and some of our local brands .
% uh i think right now the local bags and shoe brand , we have a home grown brand called % uh charles and keith .
they are found in % uh number twenty two , that 's ion .
% uh number twenty six , okay .
% uh and also twenty three , alright ?
so these are- and of course over in number forty seven alright , that 's plaza singapura .
they are found in these shopping mall so this is % um home % uh home grown so i do n't think you have this brand in % uh philippines .
yah .
the brand that i just mentioned , you can buy them .
% uh otherwise if you do n't like this brand % uh or you do n't like- you ca n't find any of the % uh correct patterns that you want , in all these shopping centres you 'll be able to find other % uh stores % uh selling shoes , bags .
so all these shopping centres will have % uh things like shoes , bag , % uh sunglasses , % uh jewellery okay , they can be found in all these shopping complexes .
yah .
% uh what particular- % uh which % uh particular government offices you would like to visit ?
alright .
okay .
the post offices % uh yes because it 's a public area so you can just walk in to any of our post offices in singapore .
% uh the city hall right now is % uh not used as a city hall anymore we are % uh refurbishing it .
so we 're renovating it and it 's going to become one of our art gallery .
% uh what i will suggest is if you want to pay a visit to our ura , that 's near to the chinatown area , it 's called urban renewal authority .
% uh they- we do have a very good city gallery , a gallery that you can see % um the whole map of singapore as well as % uh the central part of singapore .
yes we have a very good % uh national museum at the bras basah area .
so- % uh that will showcase singapore from the beginning right up to % uh the present day .
yes .
so % uh it showcase you % uh even before raffles ' arrival % uh right through % uh to second world wa~ % uh and then raffles arrived , where do people live you know we have kings before .
and we move on to the second world war period from nineteen forty three to nineteen forty five and to present day , alright .
% uh to col~ % uh to independence to merger we sing~ % uh sorry before our independence nineteen sixty three to nineteen sixty five we merged with % uh malaya to form the federation of malaysia .
and independence how we struggle through % uh to- in order to find- to build homes for the people living here , jobs , to modern day .
yes correct .
so % uh you 'll be able to % uh learn a lot about singapore in fact % uh the whole history of singapore .
yes .
so- yah .
so when you are going to chinatown , so you can pay a visit there okay , then you learn ab~ % uh sorry .
% uh the history of singapore you will learn from the national history of singapore -
% uh national % uh museum of singapore at the % uh bras basah area .
and after that you can do the ura gallery % uh and the chinatown area together .
% uh the ura , urban redevelopment authority it 's the same area as chinatown .
the national museum will be closer to the supreme court .
because you mentioned that you wanted to do some singapore % uh % uh offices , right ?
yah .
% uh we wouldn't- you can also sit-in one of the court sessions in the supreme court if you are just % uh yourself and your husband .
so any of the courts that 's open for hearing you can actually walk in % um even for a ten minutes if you just want to sit-in and you can just give-
yes .
yes .
% uh but % uh before you enter into the supreme court you will have to go through security .
so just like how you will pass through % uh the immigration while coming in % uh or leaving singapore the normal security % uh procedure that means you have check- we will have to check your bags % um and you make sure that you do not carry any % uh sharp objects and % uh there 's no- strictly no photography inside the supreme court .
okay , that 's great .
yes you are allowed to .
like i mentioned you just have to go through security before you enter into the court - % uh before you enter into the supreme court the normal % uh procedure meaning like no sharp objects and strictly no photography when you are inside the supreme court .
% uh office hours i would say .
yah .
okay .
% uh the supreme court ch~ sit-in one of the court proceedings .
% uh like i said if you do n't want to sit you can sit-in for as long or as short as you want to .
and the ura would be % uh a good introduction to our city landscape .
yes .
like i said you can do it with- together with chinatown .
supreme court you can do it together with the national library - % uh sorry % uh national museum of singapore .
okay .
and the-
% oh yes .
the library is also located near the % uh bras basah area .
so national library , national % uh museum , supreme court .
yes .
pretty nearby .
yah .
so-
the library is a green building .
that means they have a lot of % uh green itianative- % uh initiative that is % uh built into the whole library .
but we have a lot of other % uh community libraries all found within the various estate in singapore .
okay .
right .
% uh we have % uh sungei buloh which is on the northwest of singapore .
so you saw the supreme court , right on the screen ?
yah , that 's the picture of the supreme court .
so you can do another wildlife walk over at sungei buloh .
% uh that is northwest .
yah .
okay .
there are mangrove and % uh wetland wildlife so a lot of birds .
can you saw a picture now of the sungei wetland ?
okay .
yah .
okay .
alright .
so this is % um what we have out at the % uh northwest of singapore .
and we do have a free wireless % uh trail .
okay , you can just % uh sort of % uh borrow the % uh % uh % uh webcam .
okay .
and another % uh other walks that you can do you climb % uh bukit timah hill as well .
well % uh bukit timah is not a mountain it 's a hill .
we do n't have mountains in singapore unfortunately .
our tallest hill is bukit timah but it has a lot of % uh flora and fauna .
% uh it 's three hundred and eighty six % uh metres tall .
how many floor ?
approximately about % uh sixty- i would say i think in a region of about sixty to seventy storey .
a bit high ?
% oh but you are not going to climb steps it 's like % uh a slope going up the hill and % uh well you can do it within- you can climb from the bottom to the top of hill .
it is not % uh a too fast running up just walking a brisk walk you should be able to arrive in one hour .
% uh no you have to climb up .
yah .
but you see a lot of interesting plants % uh when you are up on the- % uh along the way up to the hill .
okay just % uh- i think you should be able to see a portion of the road climbing up to bukit timah .
okay you 've seen that ?
the visitor centre .
okay i 'll come back to the hotel .
okay now let-
yes .
alright let 's go to the hotels in singapore % uh . there are lots of different category of hotels so again it depends on % uh what you 're looking at .
% uh there are budget hotels .
if you like to stay in orchard road , % uh since this is a birthday celebration % uh-
yah you can consider staying around orchard road .
there are lots of- yah there are lot of hotels on orchard road so it all depends on your % uh price % uh category .
% uh starting from % uh- just beginning of orchard road % uh at the junction of scotts road we have like hyatt hotel , marriott hotel .
okay .
and you move on we have grand park hotel .
so again i 'm coming back to the stretch of orchard road % uh .
we have like % uh % uh york hotel just beside the goodwood park hotel , elizabeth hotel .
okay so % uh these are all the various hotel that is located on % uh % uh orchard road .
and then if-
yah .
yes , that 's fine .
% uh they do have % uh you can have a one night stay % uh in the various hotel so normal check-in like two to three o'clock in the afternoon % uh and the next day the check out time % uh is around twelve o'clock % uh the next day .
alright .
okay there are quite a number of hotels % uh what you mentioned .
% uh there is like % uh fullerton bay hotel , it 's like a five-star luxury hotel .
% uh the the- and this building just now you mentioned about post office , right ?
it used to be % uh the first % uh central post office in singapore but it 's now converted to % uh fullerton hotel .
so that 's one , it 's a five-star luxury .
% uh we have at city hall mrt fairmont hotel .
on sentosa itself since i think you may also visit sentosa you could stay at the capella .
but these are- like i mentioned these are % uh five-star luxury hotels .
yah .
okay , or you could also stay at the marina bay sands .
% uh this is like % uh landmark building .
% uh it faces the marina bay so you get a good % uh view and of course remember to ask for the bay view side of the hotel , okay .
% uh and around the bay you have other hotels like % um the pan pacific , the mandarin oriental , these are all % uh nice hotel .
okay so lots and lots of hotels available if you just want something very special .
yes , and also % uh the budget % uh that you would like to spend because % uh they range % uh from- in the region of about singapore dollars one night stay about four hundred plus .
yes , they are five-star hotel .
okay .
if you are talking about % uh let 's say % uh a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars ?
okay , we have some of these hotel .
there is one in the orchard belt it 's called the hotel supreme , it 's near to the plaza singapura .
okay .
east village ?
okay that 's a bit far off .
yah , it 's a little bit far off .
% uh okay , maybe i can also recommend you this hotel called % uh link hotel .
it 's in-
link , l i n k .
link hotel .
% uh it is located in the residential area called tiong bahru and you are about % uh just one mrt away from chinatown .
alright .
or % uh- that 's a three-star hotel , we move down it 's oxford hotel .
it 's also a good location % uh but they do n't have facilities like the spa .
okay but you can stay there as well for one night then you do your museums , your ethnic area and then the next day you move to a nice hotel .
yah .
so that would be in the region of below two hundred dollars per night .
% uh yah , that 's right .
okay .
sentosa of course the best- % uh there 's a-
what you- okay .
sentosa there are lots of things , there is the beach , alright .
so you can do your morning % uh swim in the beach , the lagoon .
then you can go to the universal theme park .
you can go by % uh cable car to sentosa form % uh either mount faber or harbourfront .
can you see the map now of sentosa ?
okay .
okay so you c~ it 's an island .
% uh okay sentosa , can you see a % uh a bridge ?
a broad wall ?
okay , can you see that ?
okay .
so it 's linked to the mainland , it 's an island off the southern part of singapore .
so it is one big playground .
it 's one big playground , alright .
now-
% uh sorry , what did you say ?
% oh karting , yes .
yah .
% uh we have what we call the luge .
it 's a little bit similar , % uh you can ride on this vehicle .
yes , something like that .
% uh but there is % uh fixed routing that you have to do .
right .
yes , so you-
% uh i would n't say it 's like a bicycle , you do n't ride you know .
you basically press on like % uh accelerator .
a little bit like % uh those bumper cars but it 's not built like a bumper car it is more open .
let me see .
okay i will show you what the luge is like .
yah , % um-
yah .
% uh no . this one you will have to pay extra % uh- okay there are different % uh admission prices .
so let 's say if you want to do % uh the two- % uh the luge alright % uh that 's eighteen dollars .
two luge that means two ride .
% uh now can you see this people doing a luge ?
yah .
so it 's a little bit like bumper car but it 's not so covered , right ?
that 's the skyride .
yah .
so it 's quite great fun % uh doing the luge .
the prices for just one luge and one skyride will be twelve dollars and fifty cents per person .
yah .
so this is the extra % uh prices that you will have to pay
and then you can go over and do the % uh resort world like % uh the universal studio .
yes .
okay .
okay sure .
anyway thank you for calling % uh me alright , and i hope i have been helpful , alright ?
okay you have a good day then .
okay , bye .
bye .
bye .
hello .
hi , good afternoon .
this is % uh tour guide one .
lynnette here .
okay , i 'm fine catherine .
% uh so i hope you 're feeling great as well .
okay , so how may i help you ?
okay .
alright .
yes .
right .
alright .
okay , and you are coming with % uh- how many people are you coming with ?
right .
and your nephew is below twelve ?
okay .
so % um well first of all we would have- over here in singapore we speak- a lot of us speak english .
our street signs are all in english .
so you do n't really have a problem with communications .
now , when you arrive in the changi airport , do get some singapore money first .
exchange some money first with our money changer booth .
they are found both in the transit area as well as just immediately after the- % uh after you collect your bags and you exit from the airport .
there are money changers there .
just get some smalls notes like a dollar coin , two dollars notes , and five dollars to enable you to travel on our mrt .
yah .
yes , it 's not really the raining season .
% uh in s~ yah in singapore we have summer the whole year round .
yes , nice , warm weather .
and % uh- well even if it rains is not a big issue because you could always spend some time in the mall , have a cup of coffee .
by the time you finish your drinks , the rain would have stopped .
yah .
right .
okay .
so once you board the mrt , you just % uh look for the % uh machine , the ticket machine and they would tell you how much money to put in .
% uh just take note there is a deposit of one dollar .
so when you exit from your destination , remember to take back your % uh one dollar deposit .
% uh sorry , i did n't get you .
% oh yes .
once you go to the ticket machine , % uh you press your destination , which particular station you want to go to and the machine will tell you how much to pay to that destination .
% uh you will receive a card that looks like a credit card , that size .
okay , once you get the card you proceed to the % um entrance to the station , just tap your card , you go inside , % uh and airport that line is the green line is the east-west line .
so you will have to change train at the station , the second station called tanah merah .
yes .
t a n a h .
yah .
yes .
okay , there are quite of few options .
again it depends on % uh which particular area that you like to stay in .
% uh there are some % uh hotels which are fairly inexpensive % uh along orchard road .
which is on our main shopping area .
there are % uh hotels that are located in another area .
if you look at the green line , % uh that's- it 's somewhere if you look at number five which is on the south .
right ?
% uh you move up a little bit between four and five % uh there is this area called tiong bahru .
yah .
so there 's a hotel there as well called link hotel .
otherwise if you again follow the green line , you will come to % uh bugis , there 's also hotel there .
and if you move up a little bit that 's lavender .
okay , that 's % uh v hotel .
okay , you go down a little bit to the yellow line , bras basah % uh there is also a hotel out there .
and you move up the red line to orchard road , orchard- can you see orchard ?
okay .
% uh there is two other hotels there , york hotel , elizabeth hotel .
% uh they are i would say % um reasonable rates and yet you are very % uh right in the heart of the city .
okay , % uh per night % uh in the range of % uh a hundred and sixty dollars right up to two hundred dollars per room .
yah .
yes , you could .
yes , and you probably would require an extra bed for your nephew .
huh .
% uh so this is the hotel area that you are talking about .
of course you like to % uh spend a little bit more then again there are other hotels that you may want to consider along orchard road .
of course like international hotels we have hyatt hotel .
% uh down to grand park hotel .
it 's near to the somerset mrt .
in between somerset and % uh orchard road .
yes .
% uh yes .
unless you planning to change hotel every night .
otherwise , yah .
so you take the mrt for sightseeing % uh . i 'm showing this % uh mrt map for you get a feel of the different % uh lines that we have .
and just to show you the hotel location for the various % uh hotels that i 'm recommending .
yah , so there are very conveniently located because they are very near to the mrt and- it's- the mrt is actually a very inexpensive way of travelling in singapore .
yes .
right .
right .
right .
right .
okay , we have a over in- near the somerset mrt , there are a few shopping centre .
actually the whole stretch from orchard station right to dhoby ghaut every other hotel or building it 's either a hotel or a shopping mall .
right .
so our shopping hours starts from ten a.m . to nine thirty every day .
yah .
so you can do lots of shopping options out there .
so you sho~ yah , you have to do a little bit of % uh exercise before you come and do your shopping out here .
okay ?
so this is the shopping area .
so there 's always a lot of % uh things to do out here .
if you are tired , just go in to any of the cafés , % um have a smoothie or cold drink , coffee , tea , alright ?
and carry on shopping .
alright ?
so i guess for your nephew , you may want to do some sightseeing % uh with him as well , okay .
or your friend % uh , yah .
you could do a little bit of % uh sightseeing .
so let say you are staying somewhere on orchard road , alright ?
the hotel that i was talking about .
% uh in the range of two hundred dollars , you could take the subway and you alight at city hall .
okay .
you look down the red line city hall .
okay .
% oh you go to this and you just walk about five minutes .
yap .
okay , and it 's a nice area .
you just walk along the bay % uh the bay area .
the esplanade and you will see this % uh lion which is an icon of singapore .
yes .
okay , can you see now ?
okay , five minutes to the padang area , it 's a shady spot .
you can walk and then you will come to the merlion
so i would say about ten minutes .
yah .
so you can take nice picture out there because the merlion is a symbol of singapore .
yah .
and from there , you can go- opposite is a % uh nice building .
you can take a picture of this % uh building out there and that is the fullerton hotel .
yah .
so you can continue on your journey because the merlion is located in the financial district of singapore .
% uh you will just use the underpass to go across to the opposite side of the merlion , and you will board your train at the raffles place mrt .
and from there you take the west line .
okay , just give a minute .
% uh okay , you do n't really have to buy it from the merlion area , but there is a shop , a small shop at the merlion area .
okay , now i 'm showing you the map of % uh what i 'm talking about .
the merlion , can you see on the top-right hand corner ?
top-right % uh , yah .
that is the merlion .
okay .
% uh so you walk underneath the- % uh underpass .
can you see the underpass ?
okay , that is the raffles place mrt .
okay .
% uh just at this corner here , there is actually a shop there .
so if you want to pick up some % uh souvenirs , like the merlion keychain and all that .
you know , you pick it up there then you board the mrt .
okay .
and you will go down to the cha~ % uh tanjong pagar .
yah .
you alight at tanjong pagar because i 'm going to introduce you to the chinatown area .
then- yah , so i do understand you have % uh chinatown in philippines , right ?
% hm but it is a little bit different from what we have here .
% uh and you may want to visit the oldest chinese temple in singapore .
they call the thian hock keng temple .
well , just be appropriately dressed like % uh no short shorts .
% uh and try to put on like shirt or t-shirts with sleeves
yah .
so basically that 's all % uh that-
yes .
so i 'm gon na show you the image of % uh thian hock keng temple there .
so , right .
it says that % uh right now we are doing some restoration work to the temple , but it 's one of our oldest chinese- is our oldest chinese temple .
yes , you ar~ yes , you are allowed to take pictures outside the chinese temple .
in fact the most beautiful part of the temple would be the roof , where you see a lot of dragons , right ?
the dragons out there .
the roof it looks like bamboo , because according to the chinese , the bamboos are a symbol of long life .
but they are not made by bamboo , they are made of tiles .
is % uh , yah .
it 's built like- it looks like a bamboo , that 's all .
yes .
so % uh you could still do % uh- you could still go inside although the temple is undergoing restoration .
% uh just a feel % uh and a god % uh in this particular temple is dedicated to the goddess of the sea call ma zhu po .
so you could have a look inside , this chinese temple .
and when you leave the temple , this picture shows you the main entrance of the temple , you turn to your right-hand side okay , you walk about % uh four hundred metres and you will come to a hawker centre .
hawker .
% uh yes .
h a w k e r it is a non-air-conditioned food centre .
okay .
you can have a lunch .
yah , you can have your lunch there .
because the price it 's very reasonable .
okay so-
% uh it 's not a restaurant .
it 's all little shop which is about % uh a hundred metre kind of a shop , hundred square metre .
% uh and they sell a lot of different kind of food .
huh ?
yes , it 's a variety % uh ranging from chinese food to % uh malay and you can eat to indian and you can even get some western meals there as well .
alright ?
so % uh some of the local dishes , you may want to try it out , would be % um carrot cake .
okay .
so-
it 's not the-
it 's not what you think the carrot looks like .
% uh this is our version of carrot cake .
% uh it 's actually white radish .
it 's radish fried with % uh flour and egg .
and sometimes it looks a bit dark because they have been cook with a % uh dark sauce .
dark soya sauce .
okay , now can you see the word- the highlighted area ?
amoy street food centre .
so you see the red % um- thian hock keng temple , if you look at ayer- telok ayer street ?
right ?
you are here , remember i said when you leave the temple , you turn right .
so it 's about a four hundred metres walk .
okay , and you actually pass by the al-abrar mosque .
the highlighted area again , that 's % um a mosque .
% uh it 's a place of worship for the muslim .
but % uh % uh normally if you are non-muslims , we do n't encourage you to go in .
you stand outside , you could actually look inside .
so and then you just turn to the left again , you come to the amoy street food centre .
yah , so just look around the food centre .
see what looks interesting .
they are always % uh photos of the food that each of this vendor % uh sell .
yah , and again do carry a bit of singapore money with you .
'cause they are like a few dollars each .
like % uh carrot cake would probably cost about % uh two fifty , two dollars fifty cents to three dollars for one plate .
% uh as-
yah .
so it 's actually- yes it 's quite different from the % uh kind of a baked carrot cake that we often , yah .
so this is the chinese version .
right ?
and % uh of course there are lots of other delicious food .
so if you are not so % uh- if you just want something a little bit light then , you could try our fish soup with noodles .
okay .
so that would cost you a meal there would cost you three dollars for a main dish , and a drink will be in the region of a cold drink in a region of a dollar forty cents .
yah ?
so that 's taken care of .
and then you just walk .
can you see amoy street ?
okay , there is a pathway , % uh a kind of steps where you climb up .
it 's about two-story tall .
and then you arrive at ann siang hill .
ann siang hill in green , can you see that ?
alright .
so % uh these are very nice houses out here .
% um interesting i would say because some of the houses here has two doors .
the outer door which is smaller like a cowboy door .
yah and then they have a bigger door .
so these are own traditionally by the peranakan chinese .
that means the strait born chinese .
yah so bit- it 's a nice row of houses here .
okay .
and you walk down-
ann siang road again .
and you come to south bridge road .
right ?
okay .
and you walk against the traffic
and you cross .
from here you can see sri mariamman temple .
yah , so this is an indian temple .
so we are doing your tour in the morning .
% uh the sri mariamman temple will be open 'til twelve o'clock in the afternoon .
in the afternoon , they still keep the front gates opened .
but there will not be so much activities going on in the afternoon .
they wouldn't- before twelve o'clock .
yes so you can do that .
% uh take a look and you have to remove your shoes before you go into the indian temple .
just put your shoes % uh in the shoe racks .
yah and do a short walk in the temple .
and when you 're out , you turn left to pagoda street .
yah .
so again you will see a lot of the chinatown % uh houses with this bamboo roof .
and you also mention you like to pick up some souvenirs .
yah so there are some chinese souvenirs that you may want to pick up .
okay .
% uh right .
so you can just walk around .
and there are some coffee shops , coffee shops meaning % uh non-air-conditioned drinking places and food place ~
right .
so anytime you are hungry or thirsty , you can always pick up some food or drinks along the-
yah .
okay .
yes .
so you follow this road again down to trengganu street .
okay .
and you make a left turn .
okay .
you come to sago street .
right .
now on sago street , there are about two shops there that sells % uh specifically chinese pastry .
yah , that you may not see in the normal % uh kind of bakery .
so there are all sorts of chinese pastry there .
okay .
alright .
so % uh and if you again want to visit another chinese temple there is another chinese temple % uh called the buddha relic temple .
it 's just in-between sago street and sago lane .
right .
% uh i would recommend the morning or afternoon zoo for you .
okay , so that like you can do like a half day , % uh almost full day already , right ?
because you were walking from the merlion right up to the chinatown .
and i guess with all this walk , you would be a little bit tired .
so in the night time , you may just want to % uh rest up for- % uh rest for a little while before you head out for dinner .
okay .
% uh we will come back to the dinner places later on .
let 's go to the zoo .
okay , the zoo is located in the % uh north part of singapore .
okay , we do have the zoo express % uh that you can take .
% uh as you can see there are different timings and % uh different % uh places of % uh pick-up .
otherwise , you can take the subway , the mrt , to ang mo kio .
and from there you board a bus to the zoo .
% ah okay .
this is the morning and afternoon zoo .
% uh if he- if your nephew like the different- % uh the animals , you can do combine both together .
so i would suggest if you want to do two attractions , you can do in the afternoon ,
% uh and dinner out in the zoo or night safari park .
there are food and beverages and fast food available in both the % um zoo and the night safari park .
right .
so % uh in the day zoo this will be more % uh mammals that you see in the day zoo .
% uh you can also do- % uh there 's also a tram ride that you can take , and then % uh in the middle of the zoo , you can alight and walk around , do a little bit of the % uh attractions .
and then you board back the tram .
alright , same thing with the night safari .
the night safari , you were going to see different animals .
the night safari will be % uh ninety per cent- % uh it 's , yah .
ninety per cent will be nocturnal creatures , % uh like the leopards , the tigers which are nocturnal creatures .
no , our zoo - both our zoo and night safari so they are called open zoo .
so you wo n't see cages .
% uh they are thro~ they are put in % uh as close as possible to what they would live in the wild .
yah , but not to worry .
they do not come out of their so-called enclosure .
% hm so it 's really-
yah .
it 's beautiful , it 's like park , you know .
is- i 'm showing you now % uh just portion of the day zoo .
and let 's go to the night safari park .
okay , this is our night safari park .
yes , so you can see the first picture ?
these are wild malayan tapir .
so you 'll be getting on this tram .
% uh it 's a open tram , alright .
% uh and these animals are wild creatures , so do not stretch out any part of your body .
alright , and do not touch the animals , they are wild animals .
the leopards % uh they are separated from you by the glass enclosure .
% uh no feeding because they are wild animals .
and the zoo and the night safari have a standard % uh feeding time for the animals .
so we do n't want them to get overweight , right ?
okay .
so this is % uh- it will be very interesting .
you get on the tram ride and in the middle % uh there is a stop called the leopard 's trail , you get off the tram , do a half an hour walk , to see the animals .
come back and take the next tram and you are back at the entrance .
so on the tram ride it 's about forty minutes excluding the walk .
% uh and at the e~ main entrance , there is another walking trail called the fishing cat trail .
so this is the % uh night safari .
okay .
there are like shows if your nephew is interested , we have the creatures of the night show .
this- yah .
so what the safari do is they bring up some of the animals , the smaller animals , and % uh- it 's just a- it 's a simple show % uh to show you how basically animals behave .
that 's about it .
alright , we do n't dress them up because they are still wild animals .
and the show time is seven thirty , eight thirty , and nine thirty p.m. % uh if the weather permits .
alright ?
so this is the shows that you can do- % uh i would recommend a minimum of two hours in the night safari park .
of course if you can spend three hours , that would be better .
yah ?
so if you do n't want to walk , then forty minutes on the % uh tram ride .
but i definitely recommend you to do at least one walking trail at the leopards trail .
so i will show you the walking trails , because on the tram ride , you see seventy per cent of the animals .
the balance of thirty per cent you will have to walk .
so we divide the park into the various sector like himalayan foothills , the nepalese river valley .
okay .
equitoria~
yah .
yah for each of the sector .
so you will have % uh areas that stimulate the natural habitat of these different animals that are found in these areas .
yah , so this is the night safari park .
right .
yah it 's a very popular tourist spot for both the locals and the tourists .
right ?
so- and i guess your nephew may also be interested to do the jurong bird park as well .
if he 's into birds .
okay .
right .
alright .
so- yah , we have like again different walks .
and i think you should not miss the lorry loft .
okay .
see now these lorries are free flying .
and you can feed them .
okay , but you can not feed them with human food .
so we feed them with the honey water and that 's available in the lorry loft itself .
huh .
so and the birds , the lorries will come and perch on your hand , to feed .
because when you 're holding this bowl of honey water , all the birds will come .
so it makes a very good pictures , alright , for your family .
yah , and there are so colourful .
yah .
so these are the ones .
and of course also do not miss the show .
yes .
% uh night safari or show ?
% uh both the night safari and the jurong bird park ?
the zoo .
okay .
okay .
for the adult it 's fifty eight dollars .
% uh the child is thirty eight dollars for the three parks .
jurong bird park .
so what you can do is you do the jurong bird park in the morning , there 's a zoo in the afternoon and the night safari in the night time .
yah and that 's like a full day programme already .
so the night before , get a good rest .
'cause you 're doing three parks in one day .
okay .
alright .
and the following day , you can get a bird 's eye view of singapore by going to take a ride on the singapore flyer .
singapore flyer .
a ferris wheel .
% oh you do n't like that ?
% oh okay .
okay .
so you stay on the ground and take pictures for them .
it 's a enclosed % uh ferris wheel .
it 's like a % uh cable car that goes in a circle .
yah , there .
you see % uh the enclose , right ?
the enclose area .
alright .
right .
okay .
so you can do that and again if you want to do some local food the ground floor area there is another % uh food centre on the ground floor area .
yes .
% uh that is the marina bay .
the marina bay .
so it 's just very close by .
you can go to again , okay , that 's another view of the % uh singapore flyer it 's like a cabin .
okay , and then you saw the bay , right ?
the bay .
okay .
so you walk on this % uh bridge , a very interesting bridge that looks like our % uh dna bridge .
okay .
to go to the marina bay sands .
% uh okay , % uh yah , unless you are guest .
% uh and you are staying at the mari~ of course yes .
% uh otherwise , if you want to again have a bird 's eye view , % uh from singapore to the south china sea , to the city centre , % uh you can buy a ticket to go up to the skypark .
yah , right on top of the % uh three hotels .
can you see now the skypark ?
okay .
yes , so you have different % uh-
different view , alright ?
so you see the sea view , so that is towards % uh the south china sea .
okay , % uh from a three , number three , right up to number seven you will see the city- singapore city view .
alright , so it- could you see a very good view % uh of the skyline ?
yes , correct .
but you can walk around , alright .
% uh you can around this % uh cantilever .
okay , the cost of a ticket-
it 's twenty dollars for an adult and fourteen dollars for a child .
yah .
okay , yah .
and % um once you come down , okay , you walk across the % uh underpass .
and you can do the restaurants .
okay , there are lots of restaurants out there .
% hm they have- if you like chinese food , then maybe i can recommend you ding tai fung .
and there are lots of other kind of a cuisine out here in the % uh marina bay sands area .
alright .
okay and of course but i guess with a kid , you may want to go to the casino , huh ?
% oh okay .
okay .
% uh the casino is just in the basement area , so you can have % uh some fun out in the casino as well .
% hm okay .
or you can even do % uh the museum .
yes .
okay , both of you , right ?
we do have a-
right .
yes , in the marina bay sands yes there is but not in all the other mall .
% uh only selected ones % uh do offer this service .
so you could do that , yah .
and i think he could be interested in this % uh arts and science % uh museum .
in the marina bay sands as well .
okay .
so this is % uh the permanent % uh gallery .
okay , that 's what you will see .
it 's all about arts and science .
okay , so you could do that and that would be almost % uh more than half a day already .
and but of course again you can do a spot of % uh shopping out there as well .
yes , we do have .
% uh it 's in the clarke quay area it 's on sunday .
yes , it 's only on sunday .
otherwise we do have a flea market % uh in sungei road .
yah .
okay , let me just show you the flea market in % uh-
sungei road , huh .
okay these are the flea market .
it 's operates everyday % uh from four p.m . onwards .
yah .
so % uh they really sell all kinds of stuff in this flea market .
okay , and we want to go to little india , right ?
indians .
not necessary .
okay .
just that % uh traditionally , this was a % uh an indian quarters .
alright .
traditionally .
okay , now , i 'm showing you some of the images in little india .
okay , the first picture is a light up % uh in this festival which normally happens in august .
it 's call % uh deepavali .
and this is one of the street , the second picture will show you % uh street in little india .
the third one is this food is called rojak .
it means like % uh mix and match of various kinds of food that you like .
and they serve you with this orangey kind of gravy which is a little bit sweet and just a tinge of spice in there .
% hm and the things are deep fried .
alright .
the next picture again quite commonly seen in little india , these are flower garland shop .
% uh the white flowers that you see will be jasmine flower .
the white ones .
yah .
and % uh these flower garlands are brought by the hindus when they go to the temple , the indian temples to offer their prayers .
so they offer these flower garlands to their gods .
alright .
and then we just move downwards .
okay .
you see a very elaborate structure ?
okay .
this is the main entrance of a hindu temple .
alright .
okay , again more street scenes in little india .
okay , another food that is served in little india .
so some of the local food will be like vadi .
vadi looks a little bit like a doughnut .
and you can eat it .
normally the store owner will give you a green chili as well .
so you take a bite on the green chili and a bite of this vadi
so it 's something very local .
% uh if you do n't want to eat the chili , then you just eat the doughnut .
yah , % uh it 's like- it 's called vadi .
yah .
so that gives you a little bit of an idea of what % uh little india has .
here again more pictures of what little india has .
and you may want to do a temporary tattoo which we call it henna painting .
that will cost you about five dollars .
okay , some % uh souvenirs in case you want to buy will be like brassware .
boxes , the jewellery boxes , % uh jewellery boxes made of wood .
okay hanging things , ornaments for the house .
and bangles , okay ?
plastic bangles a bunch of them would cost you a few dollars , about five dollars .
okay and saris .
the next picture that i am highlighting will be % uh a sari that is five point five metres .
and you wrap it around your waist and you wear with a short blouse .
alright .
so these are traditionally worn by the south indians .
okay .
so this is what we can do in little india .
okay ?
lots of se- pictures out here .
so very colourful , % uh
and then i 'm going to highlight this one .
it's- naan .
alright .
naan .
% uh you can either eat this with a curry or you can have side dishes like tandoori and you can see they are served on banana leaf .
% hm , you 'll get-
yah .
this is the traditional way of eating indian food , and you eat with your hands .
okay .
and of course there are hotels there located in little india as well .
lots of picture for you % uh to see % uh okay and the souvenir that i 'm talking about , these are jewellery % uh boxes that i highlighted to you here .
okay .
so all this-
teens that we will see in little india .
the mrt train station is called little india mrt train station .
okay .
so you could do again the like three hours , you know .
and the temporary tattoo will last you for about seven days .
yah , if-
if you do n't wash your hands of course it 'll last longer .
yah .
so that is the temporary tattoo made from the henna plant .
yes .
so i think we would-
i think you will have quite a packed programme in singapore .
alright .
so is there anything else that i could help you with ?
okay .
okay .
welcome .
alright .
welcome .
bye .
bye .
hi , good morning .

okay .
and how many days do you plan to stay here ?
okay , sure .
and % uh who will you be coming with ?
okay , and how old are your children ?
and is this your first trip to singapore ?
alright .
and what are your interests ?
so do they like % uh adventure or do they like % uh nature ?
okay , both .
yah sure .

and how about your- the % uh- yourself and your husband ?
okay .
just for the kids ?
alright .
so are you having any special celebration ?
okay .
so it 's a birthday celebration then ?
right .
okay .
and % uh is there any food that the children like to eat ?
right .
okay , and how about % uh- what is the budget that you are looking % uh to spend here ?
alright .
% uh no that's-
that 's fine .
and how are you % um- i would assume you are flying in , right ?
okay .
so and % uh how do you plan to travel % uh from the airport to your hotel ?
okay , sure .
and % uh is there any particular area of singapore that you like to stay ?
yes .
so- okay .
so % uh street food , it 's fine with you as well ?
alright .
okay .
so what i 'm going to do is % um i 'm going to show you % uh a rough guide of the % uh mrt map in singapore .
yes .
okay .
okay , i 'm going to show you the map .
okay i think it should be downloading now .
okay .
is it better now ?
well on my side it 's actually big .
okay .
anyway .
never mind .
% uh what i 'm going to do is % uh if you look on the right-hand side of the map , that 's changi airport which is number three .
it should be a green line .
so this is a map of the mrt .
mrt stands for mass rapid transit train .
okay .
do you know what all these colours means ?
very small , okay .
okay , i 'm trying to enlarge again .
it does n't help ?
yes .
yah it 's actu~
yah .
yes .
it 's supposed to be a big- % uh the full screen .
i see .
okay .
% uh , okay .
i think we forget about this map at the moment .
but let say if you- are looking at the screen on the right-hand side will be changi which is on the east .
yes .
or the red line will be the north .
on the left-hand side of the screen is the west .
that 's jurong .
the- yes , that 's the end .
and if you look down on the % uh top-bottom part of the screen , that 's towards the south .
yes .
alright .
okay , you look at the green line number three .
changi airport .
yes .
so the- can you just go towards your left and you will see % uh the intersection between the purple line , yellow line and red line .
yah .
that is dhoby ghaut .
dhoby ghaut is- all the names that is stated on the screen are mrt train station .
it 's okay now .
okay .
right .
so dhoby ghaut is a line where you can change the different line .
% uh not , yah .
% uh not necessary .
depending on where you want to go to .
okay .
alright .
so what i can do is , you need me to recommend a hotel for you .
okay .
you can stay in the orchard road area .
o r c h a r d . it 's on the red line .
somewhere in the middle .
yes .
so orchard station , somerset station , dhoby ghaut station are on orchard road .
yes , it 's a road and there is an mrt train station called orchard station .
alright .
on orchard road there are a number of hotels .
alright .
okay .
can i- how much would you think you want to spend on a night stay ?
okay , i 'm listing to you % uh some of the hotels in orchard road .
yes .
sure .
okay .
% uh , okay .
i will-
and % uh which % uh- is it a weekday or weekend ?
a weekday .
yes , she is allowed to go in .
but there are certain rides that she will not be eligible to take .
yes .
okay .
so you saw % uh the website , right ?
for universal studio .
okay , so some of these like i said , the % uh attraction , the rides , she may not be eligible to take .
okay , it will be better to buy % uh online first just in case % um all the tickets are snapped up .
okay .
so this is % uh universal studio .
okay , just give me a minute .
buy the ticket .
okay .
the ticket for the adult would be sixty eight dollars .
yah , that is % uh non-par~ % uh weekday ticket .
okay .
% uh there 's no more taxes .
you can % uh use this ticket to use % uh to take most of the rides .
the kid 's price for the ticket is fifty dollars .
yes .
that is % uh non-peak hours .
and- okay .
yes .
you bring your passport .
yes .
for a weekday pass .
nope .
nothing else .
yes .
% uh generally no outside food is allowed inside the park other than % uh where you get your food from the outlets .
the food outlets in the park .
yes .
there are food available inside the park .
okay .
i 'll show you the dining .
okay , they open early .
yes .
ten to nine p.m .
but- yah .
okay , so what are the rides that your- you think your son or your children will be interested to do ?
okay .
alright .
okay .
so do you- how much- how many hours do you think want to spend there ?
% uh no . normal check-in time is % uh one o'clock .
% uh % oh yes .
sorry , at two o'clock .
okay .
so what you can do is you bring your luggage , i guess .
okay ?
and go on the % uh mrt ride .
you will have to change station .
so in the morning , you were saying that you want to do some % uh breakfast first .
okay what were- % uh do you want to eat in a hotel ?
do you want to eat in the % uh hawker centre ?
do they mind % uh non-air-condition places ?
okay the weather in singapore it 's average , about thirty degrees in the afternoon .
% uh in the early morning and late evening , % uh from eight o'clock onwards , temperature goes down to about twenty six degrees centigrade .
okay .
so you want to go to universal studio % uh directly .
% uh we-
okay , we have % uh air-conditioned food centre % uh a food court in the changi airport .
so there are street food out there .
yah .

hainanese chicken rice .
you can have also like a dim sum , you know , small little bites , like pao which is like a- taste a little bit like bread but it has a filling in there .
% uh the-
yes , they do serve this kind of food at the changi % uh food court .
changi airport food court .
yes , because you are going to arrive in the morning .
so , you can have your breakfast in the airport first .
okay ?
a~ okay .
allocate with drinks per person % uh singapore dollars , % uh ten dollars per person .
yes .
yes .
right .
so you can have a main course , that would probably cost you about five to six dollars .
and a drink which should be in the region of less than three dollars .
so a ten dollars is more than sufficient .
yah , that is right .
so you would be buying your tickets online first ?
yes .
so now we are left with about three hundred dollars ?
no , we are left is seven hundred .
okay .
that 's one thousand for the whole family , is it ?
okay .
alright .

yes .
yah .
okay .
% hm it should be in the region of two dollars and it 's two dollar and thirty cents % uh for the standard fare .

so that means you will leave the theme park , the universal studio at three o'clock ?

okay , can you see this place now ?
yes , it 's called hortpark .
okay .
okay , it's- % uh it 's not a very big park , but it is a lot of nature , plants ,
and it is very close to the harbourfront mrt .
the buses that you can take would be sixty one .
okay , from universal studio , you take the sentosa express .
it 's a train that operates only on sentosa island and harbourfront .
so you would take the sentosa express out to harbourfront .
yes , you alight at harbourfront .
and you will go to the bus stop in- harbourfront is a mrt line .
and you will go to a bus stop , a public bus stop in front of the vivocity .
so vivocity is a shopping mall % uh just above the mrt .
and these are the buses that you can take , sixty one , ninety three .
% uh si~ number sixty one .
number ninety three .
number ninety seven .
number one hundred , number one six , number four zero si- eight , and nine six three , you 'll be able to get to the hortpark .
approximately % uh forty five minutes .
yes .
travelling time approximately % uh ten minutes .
yes .
but % uh waiting for the buses , since there are so many buses , % uh you allocate for another five minutes .
yes .
forty five minutes .
yes .
it is a public park .
so , there is no admission charges .
okay .
okay .
now , from here , again you can actually take the buses .
bus number sixty one .
bus- or one six .
and you get to city hall station .
yes .
okay , so we still have a bit of money left , right ?
okay .
so you can stay at the- around the city hall station , there are a number of hotels .
okay , you can stay in this hotel called the % uh- this hotel call~ peninsular excelsior hotel .
% um it is convenient .
it is % uh in the region of % uh two hundred dollars per night .
that 's quite fine , right ?
it 's just five minutes ' walk from the % uh city hall mrt .
okay .
you can just walk about ten minutes to this place called clarke quay .
sure .
c l a r
% uh k e
yes .
% uh we pronounce as key .
yes .
yes .
q u a y , yes .
okay .
these are a lot of restaurants .
if you look at the map on your right-hand side .
yes .
% uh the blue patch is the river , the singapore river .
okay , so along clarke quay , alright ?
% uh facing the river front , there are many restaurants there .
yes .
so since your kids love chicken , there are lot of dining options there .
so , you can choose something that % uh , you know , the whole family will get to enjoy .
so i 'm giving you the list of the dining options located at clarke quay .
yes , they are all restaurants .
there are fine dining restaurants , there are casual restaurants .
okay .
well , you can do a café called coffee club .
they- although they are called coffee club , they do have % uh main courses that is serve there .
okay .
another one that you may like to consider would be hot stones .
yah .
so they serve steak and seafood on a plate ca ~ % uh and this is like a hot plate .
yes .
well not really .
okay , now i 'm going to show you another one called kingsatay .
yes .
okay , these are barbeque meat .
so you can have different kind of meat and they are pierced through a skewer and you dip that with % uh a sweet and spicy sauce .
yes .
okay , so if you do n't like the spicy , you can just % uh eat it just the skewer , the meat on the skewer and that 's fine .
yah , it taste good as well .
yes , i have .
yes , because it is something quite local .
yah .
okay , so i 'm just showing you all the list of restaurants , you know .
it ranges from spanish to mediterranean to chinese well , whatever you can think of it 's all there .
okay ?
okay .
so , yah .
that is something and of course there is % uh a burger bar as well .
because in the morning , you have tried the local food already , right ?
so you may just want to do some % uh just have a nice meal .
or if you just want to do again very local , again there is a food court just next to your hotel , the peninsular excelsior hotel .
yah , so again you can get some street food out there .
yah .
yes .
% uh singapore is a safe place .
but , you just have to , you know , take the usual precaution .
% uh avoid all the dark lanes , otherwise you can stay out late .
no issue with that .
% uh no . you can stay out the whole night if you want to .
yah .
after the whole day at universal studio , right ?
yah , so i guess % uh- yah , that should be % uh what , you know , % uh can be done in one day .
but of course there are lots of other option .
welcome .
alright .
okay .
bye .
hello .
good morning .
good morning .
julie , i 'm jeanne .
yes .
nice to meet you too .
participant eight .
% uh i 'm guide number two .
julie .
jeanne as in j e a n n e .
you are julie , j u l i e , is that right ?
% uh may i know % uh when are you intending to come to singapore ?
that 's april .
% uh huh .
and how long are you staying ?
two days only ?
% uh do you intend to come alone or do you have % uh people coming with you ?
it 's a male or a female , may i ask ?
okay .
okay .
alright then .
% uh and % uh may i just know your age range ?
are you under thirty ?
between thirty and fifty or-
% oh that 's very young then .
what are your interests ?
oh .
yah , we have beaches .
we have beaches % uh on the island .
and we also have an island called sentosa that you can go to .
% uh when you talk about hanging out , what do you mean actually ?
oh okay .
% uh that 's % uh quite normal , right ?
mall % uh that means shopping .
% uh drink coffee in between your shopping .
alright , and bar hopping .
alright .
% uh have you been to singapore before ?
% uh yes .
% uh let me show you- i think you sound quite independent .
shall i show you the % uh mass rapid transit system ?
singapore .
so that when you arrive , you can take the train -
to go to- from the airport into town the fastest way and % uh very efficient .
yes , mrt .
that stands for mass rapid transit .
here it is .
let me show you the map so you can see the whole of singapore also .
% uh just a moment .
% uh where are you intending to stay ? uh
% uh where are you intending to stay ? uh % uh what sort of % uh
what do you think ?
okay % uh .
okay , what you have here- are you getting it on the screen now ?
so do you see the green line at the bottom right-hand side ?
that is the changi airport .
and if you follow the line % uh from the right to the left .
you are entering into town .
and that is where we have maybe the better class hotels .
% uh it 's also the business area .
if you follow % uh a little bit further out .
you know where the green line hits the yellow and the red ?
yes .
you follow the green line % uh up left towards the north .
you 'll get orchard .
do you see orchard ?
orchard is a very popular road .
and that is-
you can get off there .
there are lots of % uh shops there .
night clubs .
if you go the other way when you take the train and you go down to- you switch to clarke quay , you could actually walk .
% uh that 's near one of our rivers called the singapore river .
and you might want to bar hop there at night .
affordable as in % uh what sort of price range are you talking about ?
oh that will go a long way .
just-
yes .
because % uh you are-
you are not looking for luxurious hotels .
% uh are you also % um- do you mind if the place is a little bit crammed and % uh you know , not so large but % uh in a-
in a nice place of town .
yes , that 's right .
they usually come with a television .
do you enjoy staying in chinatown or little india ?
% uh you know , those % uh what we call ethnic heritage areas .
so you step out , you can get chinese food or indian food .
we also have good class hotels there also .
the-
if you are-
okay .
if you 're talking about a mall , are you talking about modern shopping centre or we have also street side shopping .
small shops ?
okay , i 'm gon na get you hotels in chinatown .
okay ?
just .
yes , you would save a lot of money shopping .
% uh we have a good range in singapore .
you could spend it in one day .
you could spend it in a week .
yes .
if your hotel is not too % uh expensive .
okay .
let 's see huh .
just- okay , are you getting the screen now ?
so-
affordable prices , yes .
this is chinatown -
which i think is quite interesting .
i will get you little india later if you want .
but chinatown is % uh you know , you can walk out and buy things from the shops .
you can also walk to the nearest % uh train station .
and get down to orchard road .
you could walk to your bus by the river .
okay .
do you see keong saik hotel ?
okay .
i 'm not saying anything .
i just thought that % uh so have more money shopping .
yah .
yes .
let 's say- well , that 's just- these are all % um clean hotels .
you know , they are usually
feedback , you will have to google maybe and find out .
you see it has only twenty five rooms .
so let me see .
it 's a boutique hotel actually do you see the hotel description ?
i got my arrow there .
so what they 've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms so the hotel rooms are not % uh very wide .
perhaps % uh you can get off % uh your hotel room in about fifteen minutes -
go and have breakfast at the little shops nearby .
and % uh you know you could- but the shops open a bit later .
maybe about ten o'clock .
yah , right .
even the malls , they start up at about ten o'clock in the morning .
% uh depends-
mall- oh yes , you could walk down to central mall which is-
by the singapore river .
one of our latest malls .
and % uh you overlook the singapore river if you % uh for example have a ice cream in one of the- there 's an ice cream boutique there .
there 's also % um coffee joints .
yah , ninety dollars only , right ?
yes .
yes , and you could hang out at the bars .
% uh not far .
% uh you can % uh just walk to the nearest train station -
which is tanjong pagar .
and then you can take the train .
westwards .
and % uh you get off at harbourfront .
and there you can take a shuttle into sentosa .
oh it 's very low .
i do n't have the exact fare it goes by distance .
but what i advise is you get a card when you come in .
at changi airport , you go to the mrt station and you collect- you pay in advance for a card with stored value .
and then before you go back , you 'll get your change if you hand it back in .
unless you want it as a souvenir .
so you 're only paying as a singaporean would pay .
if you are taking the trains and the buses -
i think just maybe twenty dollars or even less .
it 's a- it 's because of the deposit you have to pay but you 're getting it back once you hand in the card .
it 's for the manufacture of the card .
so if you are not intending to bring it back , you know , % uh it's- it 's just the distance travelled and i think you will spend- on travel , maybe only ten dollars or so .
unless you 're travelling all the time and you 're not-
heading off and shopping or eating , you know ?
oh .
no .
no . you do n't need so much if you are using buses than train .
yah .
the only thing is if you take the train ride round singapore % um you have- and you get off say one stop from your hotel .
% uh you will have to pay a two dollar surcharge .
% uh for using the train for too long because we do n't want people to hang out in the trains .
that 's all .
% uh restaurants or bars .
you are thinking of what kind of food ?
do you take- oh yes .
great , authentic food .
let me see .
yes .
% uh you know where you are in chinatown ?
we have a very old market that has been spruced up and it 's one of my favourite places to eat .
we have also muslim food there and indian food but people go there for chinese food .
% uh let me try and see which there .
if you add a lot of food , ten dollars will go a long way .
that 's a lot .
let 's say if you bought % uh different things and you tried it on .
assuming you have a big appetite .
% uh let me see if i can get this % uh- take a look .
% uh maxwell market .
food centre , let 's see , can you see maxwell food centre there ?
okay .
now it 's actually on the edge of the business district and chinatown .
oops .
and it would be within walking distance-
from your hotel .
and really , you- even if you stay somewhere else , this is a good place to try % uh local food .
and you should go there different times of the day because in the morning you will get some stores that only sell up to lunch .
and there are some open at dinner time and supper time .
and we 've got noodles , we 've got rice .
there are also-
% uh vegetarian stalls and % uh fish soups if you are thinking of something healthy .
% uh you- do you have dietary needs ?
do you-
any of you-
oh so that 's good .
besides going to the market , there would be stalls just outside your hotel .
% uh actually i should tell you that % uh your hotel is located in what % uh maybe eighty years ago was a red light district -
but it 's full stop now .
so around that area , there are many % uh food stalls % uh and % uh coffee shops we call them actually .
% uh you want to go to % uh you was- you mentioned the beach earlier , right ?
so i 'm gon na get sentosa for you .
can i- oops just a minute .
okay , let me get back the- okay , now .
you see where you are , you could walk to the % uh mrt station .
and % uh you could- are you getting sentosa on your screen ?
so where you are is- let me see- tanjong pagar .
about maybe two- just a minute % uh . let me get on the train .
% uh can you see tanjong pagar ?
% uh right at the bottom on the green line .
are you getting it ?
okay .
you go on the green line -
and you go to outram park .
and then you switch to the north east line .
the purple line .
you just go one stop and you 're at harbourfront .
and then you can just ask anybody for directions .
the bus bay where sentosa operates shuttle buses into sentosa on a regular basis .
% uh or you could take an express then you have to go- that in fact there 's a huge shopping area there .
there are two shopping malls there , vivocity and harbourfront .
harbourfront is the older one .
at vivocity , on the top floor , you can get an express light rail system direct into sentosa .
but the easier way is you just go to the foot , the bus bay because at the bus bay again , you can get a lot of variety of food .
malay - this time you get more of the malay % uh that means % uh muslim food and indian food .
there 's also lot of chinese stalls , food stalls .
% uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls , they often go across the road to where the bus terminal is to get their food .
so it 's nice to check it out , you know , check it out first .
and if you still want to take the express train , you could .
you could cross the road and you make your way to vivocity and you can take the train in .
otherwise you can take the shuttle .
i think it cost about a dollar only extra on you .
yes .
yes , there are .
if you 'll go and swim , it 's just two dollars to enter .
but if you enter the attractions , then you have to pay more .
yes .
you need to- actually the good thing is to get % uh what do you call it ?
get to the top of mount faber which is near to harbourfront .
and % uh buy or- buy a % uh sort of a package .
and from the package , you can get lower price entry to all the attractions .
oh let me show you some of the attractions first .
because the- they are packaged in such a way that , you know , if you like adventure .
you 'll see imbiah lookout .
yes .
if you take the cable car-
you end up there on the island .
imbiah lookout is the- is the stop .
and it 's on a little hill .
from there you can walk to the butterfly park .
% uh you could % uh take a little ride , you know , on this little- like sling down the little hill but this is a concrete trail .
and they have a short cable car there but you want to take the main one across the harbour , right ?
so when you 're there , you can check out all the places there .
there are- you could walk to the beach from there too .
and there 's a museum in what used to be % uh former british military hospital converted to museum .
i suggest you visit that .
% um it 's called images of singapore .
let me see if it 's shown here .
because images of singapore gives you % uh the-
it's- % uh the history of singapore .
and-
now on beaches , you 'll see what you see now .
do you see the dolphins ?
yah , and now do you see universal world ?
if you like to go to universal studios , you could visit that .
that would-
cost a bit more money .
maybe i say about fifty dollars or hundred dollars .
% uh let me see .
can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/
because there are rides that you can take there .
but two days is a little short .
i think you need % uh five days .
okay .
okay .
universal studios % huh .
so if you stay there , you would use up your thousand dollars very quickly .
no i mean the hotel there would be , you know , more than a hundred dollars .
so we have these rides .
are you into rides ?
i mean % um-
yah .
so if you went and took these rides then , it would cost more .
but-
yah .
so yes , that would save you a lot of money .
% uh it 's a different area altogether .
% uh you have to get out of sentosa island first .
and then % uh you have to take public transport .
okay .
let me try to get you- % uh do you have the map now ?
so marina bay , you 're lucky because the train has just % uh connected to marina bay .
so you would be at harbourfront when you 're on sentosa .
so you connect with the blue line .
you could either continue to dhoby ghaut and then switch to the red line .
and % uh that is also fun
because dhoby ghaut is a major interchange and there are lot- there 's a huge shopping mall there .
so you might want to spend some time there before you change to the red line .
and go south to marina bay .
the red line is the newest line .
it 's the circle line but it has n't , you know % uh it does n't really form a circle here .
% uh do you like concerts ?
i do n't have the date with me but % uh we can check out that .
esplanade , do you see esplanade ?
then stop here .
we have major theatres there .
% uh esplanade theatres on the bay .
% uh theatre and a concert hall .
and we have shows there .
alright .
% uh we have lunch time concerts but that would be like once a month so-
it may not coincide with the time you are coming but let me see .
yah .
okay , let me see .
okay .
yah .
yes , okay .
okay .
esplanade theatres on the bay .
no events .
i 'm sorry .
yah .
% uh they are built like the old style microphones that have the % um the rounded tops so it 's like two big caps % uh on the water , let me see .
let me just see if i can get you some photos here .
here you go .
have you got it ?
it 's nice to just go there and take photos .
and there are lot of shops in there too .
% um the shops would be not like your chinatown type .
they would be-
% uh good quality shops . % uh .
very nice place to hang out .
% uh what did you say ?
your date was % uh weekend ?
is it a weekday ?
april sixteenth .
april sixteen let me check .
% ah you coming on a monday .
no , sixteenth is a monday and-
yah .
no , that is a- i 'm not sure what they have % uh on those dates right now .
% uh okay .
just a minute .
that mean-
% uh weekend is more % um fun .
it is more full of activities .
and when we are celebrating certain festivals like chinese new year or the christmas , there are lots of free performances just in the concourse area .
% uh let me see % uh .
yah , i 'm trying to find it on their own website .
grounds , all events .
okay .
okay .
march .
oh dear , do n't tell me they only gave it for this month .
you have-
you-
you- oh you can have a look at- just to get an idea of what is on right now .
so you have an idea of what we have .
and maybe on the first of january you try it when you- % uh first of april i mean .
% uh it 's usually school holiday time for the countries nearby and-
% uh singaporeans also travel so- % uh rather move around singapore 's attractions .
so we just had the school holidays over .
so that was one week of busy time at the shopping malls and the-
attractions .
% uh april , i think they 've all gone back to school .
so % uh it would not be so crowded it would be quite relaxed .
especially on a monday and tuesday i think % uh .
i find it a little bit too crowded down at orchard road on the weekends .
because everybody likes to go there .
okay .
% uh are you getting the schedule now for april ?
% uh i 'm afraid the background is black so-
sixteenth .
let me see % huh .
oh sorry .
okay .
we got a music concerto .
what % uh- oh this is interesting .
did you see this ?
south mother africa .
yes , it 's a twelve to- oh no , twelve to-
% uh no , fifteenth .
okay , let me check .
there 's dance workshop on the seventeenth .
oh wednes -
monday .
they take a break on monday .
yah , unless you 're into dance and dance workshops on the seventeenth .
that 's what we have .
you want me to open this up for you ?
okay , so three hour workshop .
and it 's only fourteen dollars .
and the person conducting i think .
you can stay as long as you like but i do n't think % uh sentosa would like you to sleep on the beach .
that 's all .
so when we have a beach party , they tell people that , you know in the mornings , we have the shuttle buses to go out .
% uh actually i do n't know about that , you know ?
but maybe the lifeguards will come around .
there are more worried about safety .
oh you could stay later than that because we have beach bars .
% um but you know , being sentosa , the prices will not be the same as % um let 's say chinatown .
% uh % hm , let me see-
if i can get the beach .
sentosa beach bars .
there you go .
okay .
% ah usually it 's on weekends , we have-
here you are .
okay .
see ?
so this is a bit more-
pardon ?
you could but frankly % uh you would have to take a trip to the island .
% uh one of our outer islands to do snorkelling % uh . there 's not much underwater wildlife on that beach .
i mean it 's merely for swimming .
% uh snorkelling .
let me see % uh . you would need to go with % uh somebody who organises it i would suggest .
and i also think you should stay longer because otherwise- it 's one whole day .
% uh no , i 'm afraid the organisers in singapore organise for outside singapore .
there is one place % uh . at sisters island but the waters there are quite rough .
and i 'm not sure because i do n't snorkel myself % uh . or rather i- % uh frankly i do n't snorkel in singapore .
no , because over there , it 's too rough for me huh .
i do n't swim .
i got to snorkel in very shallow water .
so i have to go to places where the fish come up to your feet , you know % uh in very little water .
so-
snorkelling .
you need to hire a boat and % uh wait % uh .
let me try to see if they have it somewhere else here .
'cause i do n't want to give you- wait , sorry .
so-
yes % uh . you should bring extra money if you are buying like % uh-
lap- you know if you are buying laptops or you are buying something expensive then , you know , your thousand dollars will not % uh accommodate that .
let me see .
it 's a pity .
i have a niece who go snorkelling .
and she would yes , singapore .
okay .
oh no . it's- the island i 'm referring to is too dangerous for me , i know .
% uh here , there .
do you see this ?
% uh and i have friends who go % uh surveying .
they 're actually doing it for nature .
okay .
so the waters frankly in singapore are not so clear .
the variety i 'm told is good for singapore waters .
yes % uh i have to be frank with you % um .
you can use singapore as a base to maybe indonesia or malaysia and try snorkelling there .
if you are , you know , very keen on seeing- if you like- you need to see the fish right in your eye .
colourful corals % ah .
% hm what are you thinking of buying actually ?
laptop , i suggest you go to this place called funan centre .
it 's a it mall .
okay .
yah .
okay .
let me get into the website .
usually what i advise people to do is to- okay , you have a picture of the mall there ?
go to the various shops and ask for the price of the item you want to buy and tell them frankly that you are price checking so they will give you the best price .
and then after you walk around , you can come back to the first shop .
% hm you said you are good at walking , right ?
you could walk there .
or you could take-
no , i think maybe forty minutes or thirty minutes .
or you could % um get on the street that is % uh facing the direction out of your hotel , the main street .
and just take a bus maybe two stops and you would be there .
cabs are about three dollars upwards .
three twenty upwards % uh and it 's a- we have some surcharges if you leave early in the morning like when everyone is going to office .
those are the peak hours .
and in the evenings .
but because we have the buses running also full steam and the trains they agreed- if you miss the train this morning , it was two minutes before the next train came .
so i think it 's really- it 's also more fun for you , you know ?
you 'll get to see the local people .
how we move around .
% um and where you are .
like you- i have told you , it 's so well connected .
you have lots of buses , lots of trains .
the taxis % uh in chinatown , you have to go to a taxi stop % uh to pick the taxi .
yes % uh it 's as safe in both .
you just do n't take all your bling and hang it all around you .
% uh i do n't think you 'll be doing that , right ?
% uh just take the usual precautions .
that % uh- like i said you can't- you can book the cab from your hotel or you can get reception to call you a cab .
but if you are sort of walking around chinatown , you need to find a cab station , you know , a taxi stand to get your cab .
they are not allowed to stop any and everywhere .
oh .
chinatown would be the best place .
% uh there are street stalls and there are also shops .
but like i said , you might want to walk around the whole place first .
and find out .
but usually in chinatown , they are more or less the same price for the cheap souvenirs like three items for ten dollars .
and there would be different sort of items .
% um i 'm very sorry i ca n't % uh give you better news on snorkelling .
but you can come to singapore and use the services of the companies that organise for singaporeans to go snorkelling nearby .
you know , and it would not be expensive , you know ?
% uh say again .
sorry ?
% uh huh .
okay .
you can chew gum in singapore , you just can not import gum .
that 's the miscon- you can bring in gum but if you brought in a whole carton % uh the customs would- will take it away from you because they will assume you are selling it .
so if you bring gum for two days and say it 's for my personal use , i do n't think anyone will stop you .
% uh the only thing is when you dispose of your gum you have to make sure it 's wrapped up and thrown in a bin .
or some people carry a little plastic bag and put it in the handbag until they find a proper dustbin to throw it .
% uh you also- some tourist carry a little- do you smoke ?
so , you know , they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking .
% uh i 've seen a tourist used it .
i thought it was very cute .
you- so that you can smoke % uh at designated areas but if there 's no bin to dispose of your cigarette after you smoke you just keep it back in the container .
it 's just so that you do n't break the anti-littering law .
although most of the time , nobody gets caught .
so % uh singapore may not be as clean as you imagine it to be .
% uh the restaurants also % uh they have a restriction on the place where you can % uh eat and smoke .
so it 's usually outdoors .
so it will be clearly marked out .
so you have to seat in that area which means if there are only 3 tables and they are taken then you have to go to a non-smoking area and you can not smoke there .
bring extra money for shopping , is it ?
% uh there- you still have some time with me so if you want to ask anything else .
% uh shall i go to some other sites for you ?
let me go down .
% uh clarke quay .
okay you mentioned % uh- okay .
not spelt it correctly .
the bar hopping i remember .
yes .
so i 'm going to clarke quay .
oh clarke quay bar .
no , this one is for-
okay .
% uh actually on a weekday .
i 'm not sure if it 's tuesday or wednesday .
some bars have a women 's night .
where you get it free .
the only thing is you have to dress like a woman .
they have % uh refused to let some women in who were dressed % uh not like women if you get what i mean .
% uh and % uh senior citizens .
no , they- you see , they want the ladies to attract the men there .
so % uh-
he-
yes , the ladies get in for free .
usually the cover charge is maybe twenty dollars or-
a weekday is lower than % uh weekends .
maybe just fifteen dollars .
% uh see- can you see here ?
% uh let me try and get it here .
there you go .
and lunch - a lunch at clarke quay unless they have changed it , it 's only about fifteen plus .
% uh at clarke quay .
i 've done a walk there myself and % uh i was very tempted to go in and eat .
so tuesday is drivers ' night % huh .
i do n't know how you- oh you got to be a certified then .
do you see this ?
so if you have your driver 's license .
if- you know ?
free flow house pour jug .
the whole jug at thirty dollars .
usually it 's the wednesday night that 's on- wednesdays and thursdays .
that is % uh- yes .
% hm and i suggest you stay a little bit longer because it will allow you to see more things .
you- you may- yes , for your shopping and % uh you might have extra money to go home .
or you could , you know , fill up with your shopping .
let me see if i can get orchard road shops for you % huh .
% um it 's hot and sometimes wet throughout the year .
so yes , my advice is to bring a cardigan more for the , you know , if you go in the bars , sometimes they 're cold or the restaurants .
or the air conditioning within % uh certain areas .
% uh let me see here .
okay .
the outside area would not be hot - % uh would not be cold .
although % uh these few months , we had some cold evenings which is very nice if you enjoy walking out in the open .
so in the evening times , many people go out and walk because they find it- well , firstly if they work in day , they have time only in the evenings .
yes , so here you see a scene of the light up .
can you see it works ?
that 's at christmas time .
% uh you come to see the light up .
but at the time you come , you can- we are now linking up the shops in orchard road so % um it 's not hundred per cent connected but like maybe eighty per cent .
you can walk from mall to mall without getting wet .
and as you say you enjoy walking-
it 's not a problem .
so we have the high-end , gucci .
we have also in bet- in some other shopping centres , we have % uh non-branded items .
no , you can buy .
like i said there are shops % uh that are not gucci and cartier .
% um have you heard of things like g2000 ?
yes % uh .
they are regular .
% uh % hm regular brands .
and you can buy your souvenir t-shirts in chinatown .
i hope you 'll come and % uh stay a few more days .
right .
yah .
bye julie .
your welcome .
bye .
hi , good morning .
this is tour guide one any my name is lynnette .

okay .
and what do you- do you have something in mind or what do you like to do both of you ?
% uh okay .
% uh nature as in the birds or the plants ?
both plants and % uh birds , is it ?
okay .
alright .
okay .
% um and do you have a hotel in mind ?
so you need to look for a hotel ?
okay .
so what i 'm going to do here is i 'm going to- show you this place .
it 's called the botanical gardens .
okay , sure .
so do you want me to show you the gardens first ?
or what do you want ?
okay , the gardens first ?
alright .
okay .
this is the botanical gardens in singapore .
okay .
you can be there as early as five a.m. to twelve midnight but i guess you wo n't be spending that many hours there .
okay .
so you can be- anyway the park opens as early as five a.m .
alright .
% uh so you can be there .
alright , and anytime you are ready to leave , you can leave the gardens .
alright .
but if you have- if you plan to spend a bit more time , you can go to the orchid garden inside the botanical gardens .
but that is- there is an admission charge there .
but the orchid garden only opens at eight thirty .
so do you know what you 're going to see in the orchid garden ?
% uh majority would be orchids .
okay .
but the botanical gardens , you will have all the other plants out in the botanical garden including a small jungle .
yes .
and there will be some birds % uh there as well .
okay .
so this is for the garden visit for your plants and a little bit of wildlife like the birds % uh so you can do that in the morning .
okay .
so is there any other information that you require for the % uh photography session ?
okay .
do you need me to tell you how to get there ?
okay .
now assuming that your hotel is somewhere in orchard road , there are buses available .
these are the buses available .
% uh there are quite a number of buses , it 's all stated on the website .
okay , if you want to take the mrt train station - mrt , the subway trains .
% uh yes .
it is also possible .
% uh yes .
you 're actually right there - at the eco % uh garden .
this is at the north end of the gardens .
yah , it 's quite close to the garden already .
yah .
otherwise if you % uh because there are many entrances and exit to the garden itself .
yah .
so % uh it 's fine , if you take the mrt , you can arrive at the % uh mrt % uh the botanical garden station .
okay , so .
so we can close this % uh website .
okay .
so next , we want to go to the % uh universal studio ?
okay , sure .
okay , this is % uh some of the photos that you can get % uh to do when you see the % uh hollywood characters .
so your main period- yes ?
% uh you- it is % uh- the- so are you thinking of after your morning photography student- % uh studio % uh- photography session to proceed straight to the universal studio .
okay .
% uh it is not that far away .
alright .
what you can do is you go back on the mrt .
and you take the circle line .
% uh and you will alight at the harbourfront .
yes .
in harbourfront , you will % uh get in using the % uh the sentosa express .
alright .
to get into the universal studio .
% uh no . from the botanical garden , it 's % um mrt and you can change the sentosa % uh train at harbourfront .
yah .
so that 's how you can get in .
and straightaway when you alight % uh at the station % uh to- by taking the sentosa express , you 're already at universal studio .
alright .
okay .
so % uh it will be just about right because the opening hours , opens at ten a.m .
right through seven p.m .
it's- okay it 's sixty eight dollars .
per person .
yes .
okay .
these are the tickets here .
okay , and these are the rides that 's available .
no . the- most of the rides are included unless they say that for example like the % uh amber rock climb .
that 's % uh additional charges for the children .
this one is for the children .
okay .
% uh otherwise most of the rides would be already included in your ticket .
alright .
okay .
so % uh the- i think the transformer ride is very interesting .
okay .
alright , so this is the universal studio .
and how much time do you think you want to spend there ?
oh before dinner .
alright .
okay .
so in the night time , you want to do % uh- you want to go to a bar .
alright .
okay .
so you can go to this very famous bar .
it 's called zouk .
z o u k .
yes .
okay , this is the park .
yah , this is a club .
alright .
okay .
these are some of the events , the past event .
okay .
yah .
do you need me to tell you the dress code ?
okay .
dress code will be % uh party attire .
and because they have won % uh few years .
for a number of years , they have won the nightspot of the year .
yes .
okay .
did- yah .
and do you need me to tell you how to get there ?
okay .
again it 's quite accessible by the % uh subway train station .
you just have to walk a little bit .
the closest station would be % uh at the tiong bahru mrt train station .
okay .
% uh it 's about ten minutes ' walk from the mrt .
well , you do n't have the lights out there .
it 's % uh pretty % uh simple on the outside so you do n't see like a lot of % uh new lightings .
but it is % uh one of almost % uh world famous club % uh in singapore .
so if you want to party % uh this will be one of the nightspot .
okay .
yah .
okay .
another club that i can % uh recommend you will be called okay , this is the other % uh club .
alright , that % uh we have in singapore .
which is again pretty % uh popular with the local as well as the tourists .
okay , it 's called one-altitude .
yes .
okay , usually people would start going in by ten o'clock .
alright .
and it finish late like till two a.m .
this is about the usual time that people goes to the club .
and the other % uh club that i like to introduce you would be called one-altitude .
okay .
so this is % uh- you have top of the world feeling .
this is- it 's actually a bar .
a gallery and bar .
yes .
you got a good view % uh from the top of the building .
okay , again this is very accessible by the mrt .
you alight at raffles mrt .
raffles place mrt and it 's just right there .
okay .
okay so you have two clubs to go to already .
okay .
alright .
we have along orchard road lots of shopping .
okay .
let me just show you this .
okay .
now this is a shopping complex called paragon .
okay .
% uh it is located on orchard road .
and the closest mrt train station would be called orchard station .
it 's just five minutes ' walk from orchard station .
alright .
so this is one option , other the other option- so you have all the branded goods out there .
and because you are a tourist , now , when you buy something from a bigger company .
% uh remember to get the gst tax refund .
it 's the- it 's the vat , you know ?
but we call it gst here .
it stands for goods and services tax .
okay when you get the form % uh you can always claim back the seven per cent upon % uh you leaving singapore .
okay .
now if you are going to put your purchases in your handbag
alright .
it 's okay .
you will check-in as usual at the check-in counters .
after you get your boarding pass , you go inside the immigration .
okay .
immediately after the immigration , you will be able to see a big sign that says gst .
okay , just approach counter with your purchases and your % uh receipt alright , that has been stamped % uh by the retailer and you present this to the officer .
and they will be able to refund you , your money in whatever currency you wish .
or to % uh mail back the % uh refund to you via your % uh credit card to credit back your gst % uh to your credit card .
so it 's very easy .
okay .
if you want to put your purchases in your luggage , then it 's slightly different .
okay .
what you can do is your purchases are going to be put inside your luggage when you arrived in the airport -
at both ends of % uh at one end of the airport area , you will find a gst counter .
now bring your purchases , your % uh receipt to the- and of course your passports and tickets .
and bring it to the officer that 's located there .
present all these items and the officer will do a stamp for you .
okay now , bring everything to do your normal check-in at the check-in counter .
okay .
once you have done your check-in with your boarding pass , proceed into the immigration counter and you look for the gst sign again and you will be able to get back your tax refund .
% uh sounds easy ?
okay .
alright .
so that 's how you claim back the gst .
and- okay , so this is one % uh shop but to the shopping again for your branded goods .
this would be one of the options .
i think the prices here for branded goods are still % uh very competitive .
alright .
now another shopping centre , you may want to consider would be a nice shopping centre called ion .
yes .
% uh park .
close to the park .
sorry , which-
oh yes .
again this is just- this is even nearer to the orchard mrt train station .
when you exit from the mrt % uh this is the shopping centre .
yes , just a five minutes ' walk .
alright .
so you are just very close-by to one another .
and do you want me to recommend another shopping centre for you ?
okay .
okay .
this is another shopping centre here called ngee ann city .
okay , it 's just again on orchard road .
it 's just beside ion .
% uh you have ion , then you have another shopping centre called wisma atria .
and then you have this big shopping centre called ngee ann city .
okay , so does your friend only wants to do % uh shoes , the branded shoes ?
okay , there is a sh- % uh on the ground floor , there is a shop that sell some % uh local souvenir .
in ngee ann city .
so you can get some % uh souvenirs out there .
okay , otherwise i have given you the categories of the shops that is found in % uh ngee ann city .
so for example if you are looking for % uh fashion accessories .
okay , these are all the various shops that has all the fashion .
okay , can you see from high fashion ?
okay , to % uh- midrange as well .
leather goods .
okay .
% uh midrange kind of leather goods will be u.r.s . okay , on pedder .
okay , the rest are high-end branded goods .
okay .
yes .
so how about food wise ?
% uh what kind of food do you like ?
okay , singaporean food .
okay .
then you go to next door called wisma atria .
there is a food court .
and you can try some of our local street food out there .
okay .
% uh okay .
the wisma atria is called % uh food republic .
yah .
% uh and one of the local food that i would like to recommend you would be fried hokkien noodles .
sorry ?
% uh fried hokkien noodle .
% uh this is actually made out of the yellow kind of noodles .
yah .
can show you how it 's done- hokkien noodles .
this one .
yes .
i think that 's enough , right ?
okay .
so basically we fry this % uh dish
okay .
so % uh okay , i think we have enough of the food otherwise we get too hungry .
okay , and now what 's % uh- so let 's go back to % uh paragon again .
okay .
alright .
so that 's too % uh attract you to try this local food out here that is very popular in singapore .
% uh of course we have a lot more % uh dishes .
% um okay .
% uh for example we have satay in singapore .
yah .
it 's a meat- different kind of meat that is pierced through a skewer and it 's barbecued over % uh charcoal .
okay .
% uh yes .
that is something you want to consider as well .
and of course our very famous % uh chicken rice .
yah .
okay .
so % uh do you still need to do some more photography session ?
okay .
we have another place called % uh the % uh sungei buloh or even bukit timah hill .
okay .
do you like to do a little bit of % uh climb ?
okay .
so i can recommend you bukit timah hill .
okay , bukit timah hill is singapore tallest hill .
alright .
yes .
and % uh again , there are lots of flower and fauna .
a bit of % uh a bird 's life .
okay .
but i would say it 's small birds and fauna .
and it is popular with the local who goes for the morning or evening walk up the hill .
okay .
okay .
you will have to take a bus .
because right now the mrt is not ready at this moment .
so you will have to take a bus to go there .
okay this is % uh just a photo scene .
lots of trees .
okay .
% uh of course , you will get to see some monkeys as well .
% uh do not touch them .
okay , so- and- you will have to take a bus called % uh bus one seven zero from orchard road .
okay .
% uh allocate about % uh forty minutes bus ride .
from orchard .
weighting time approximately about fifteen minutes to get to this park .
okay .
yes , we have this place called little india .
and % uh this is a ethnic area in singapore .
alright .
so traditionally % uh the indians used to live here in the past
okay .
okay , i 'm just going to show you some images of little india .
okay , can you see ?
it 's a very colourful area .
% uh on what kind of market are you talking about ?
okay .
there is a wet market in little india mrt train station .
% uh they sell- it 's like a non-air conditioned supermarket .
so all the stores sells meat , vegetables , flowers % uh and they open till twelve o'clock in the afternoon .
so there is the market if- i understand what do you mean by market .
okay .
so would you want to try some indian food ?
okay .
now i 'm going to show you this food .
it 's colourful , right ?
okay .
this is called indian rojak .
so you would pick the different dishes that 's % uh available in the store .
and the vendor , the food centre will cook for you .
it 's mainly deep fried .
alright .
and they serve you with this orange coloured gravy .
yah .
which is not that spicy .
it ' just a tinge of % uh spice in there .
okay .
and % uh so it 's like everything mixed together so we call this indian rojak .
yah .
now if you- okay .
so this is one dish .
okay .
are you also % uh do you want to eat other things-
in little india ?
okay .
% uh we have like chapatti .
% uh yes .
it 's a kind of bread made from wheat flour .
and there 's also other kinds of bread like % uh curry naan .
okay , this is the picture of the bread , the naan .
okay , you can eat it plain , you can have garlic naan .
so it 's actually taste quite good on its own .
you can dip them with curry .
chicken saag curry , mutton curry .
and you can have another version % uh of like pancake , indian pancake that 's called % uh roti prata .
okay .
so these are quite typical % uh indian food that we have here .
so it 's so colourful .
i think you may also get good pictures down in little india .
okay .
now sentosa % uh universal studio is in sentosa .
alright .
okay .
it 's a whole island of % uh recreational % uh activities that you can do there .
okay , so you have the beach .
okay , can you see the bottom part ?
that 's the beach area .
the beach , okay .
we have a few beaches out here .
so i like to show you this pahlawan beach .
okay , this is the beach out on sentosa .
this is called pahlawan .
then we have siloso beach .
okay , these are basically lagoon so % uh the % uh it 's a nice place and you can see people also playing % uh beach volleyball .
% uh same thing .
you can- if you 're on universal studio , you can just take the beach % uh the sentosa express , the train on sentosa and you alight at the beach station .
okay , and you 're at the beach .
so it is better to do % uh universal studio together with the attractions on sentosa .
okay .
you can do the spa .
okay , can you see the- a number of spas there .
would you- do you like to do spa ?
okay .
the mon- % uh there are about five spas that 's available % uh on the % uh island itself .
okay .
okay .
okay , this % uh fish reflexology , it 's % uh like a foot massage .
but they use the fish .
so these fishes will actually eat up all your % uh so called % uh dead skin .
and they- so what you will feel is this nibbling , ticklish % uh sensation .
so what the fish do is they nibble at your ni- dead skin .
okay .
so it 's quite % uh unique .
okay % huh . yah .
so the cost , do you want to know the cost ?
okay .
now , this % uh they have different time % uh kind of % uh package .
alright , if it 's % uh forty minutes , that would cost you thirty eight dollars per session .
and % uh fifty minutes will cost you fifty two dollars per session .
% uh no , it 's just the % uh fish nibbling at your feet .
this is the fish reflexology over at the % uh underwater world .
okay .
the % uh- there are other % um- for the- if you want to do this fish reflexology % uh you can actually combine it with going into the underwater world .
because % uh they charge for % uh the- okay , can you see now ?
the fishes are- you dip your feet into this pool and the fishes would nibble at your % uh feet .
alright .
and of course if you want to do body massage , these are the various % uh % uh centres that you can % uh do your body massage .
okay .
night safari % uh opens in the night time .
it is located in the north of singapore .
you will have to take % uh mrt and a bus .
yes .
okay .
so this is the % uh night safari .
okay .
% uh okay .
when you are inside the park because this is a park that opens in the night time .
% uh if you want to take photography % uh you would have to take it without flash .
okay , for- if you 're taking on the animals , then you have to take that without the flash .
yah .
yes .
alright .
okay .
park .
just for the % uh night safari park , right ?
% uh in the night safari , you would see % uh things like % uh the giraffes -
okay .
% uh the malayan tapir , the leopards .
okay .
so these are the things that you 're going to see in the % uh night safari park .
the % uh okay .
% um okay .
so these are the- alright .
alright .
it should cost you about seventy % uh two dollars .
and % uh you do n't have to walk in the park if you do n't want to .
yes .
it 's % um tram .
okay .
so you can get on the tram ride and % uh you will see more than seventy per cent of the animals .
yes , the tram ride is included in the ticket .
the whole ride will cost you forty minutes .
alright . it will take about-
alright . it will take about- it will take you forty minutes to go around the park .
% uh and if you do n't want to take the tram , you can do walking as well .
% uh yes , you can also walk .
there are three trail , that 's one that you 're looking at .
it 's called the leopard 's trail .
% uh on this trail , of course you see other animals but the highlight would be to see the leopard 's trail .
there is another called the fishing cat trail .
% uh this is located near the entrance area .
okay .
there are % uh two shows there .
okay , one is called the % uh- okay , this show here .
the first picture that you saw , okay , is the fire show .
% uh and the other one would be the creatures of the night .
that 's what you 're looking at now .
okay .
this is the % uh- okay , this is the creature of the night .
now basically it 's a twenty minute show % uh and they will just bring out some animals for you to see .
the show timing would be in % uh at seven thirty , eight thirty and nine thirty % uh provided it is not raining .
okay .
% uh the other show , the fire show will be at eight o'clock and nine o'clock .
and that the fire show is located outside the park .
so once you get into the night safari , you have to buy the tickets .
and you enter in .
you can buy without the tram ride if you want to .
% uh but i would recommend that you take the tram % uh and the walk .
okay .
in the tram ride , there will be a person a guide doing the commentary .
% uh what animals you are looking at .
but on the walk % uh you will be doing the walk by yourself .
get to see about % uh more than seventy per cent of the animals .
and the balance of thirty per cent , you will have to do the walk to see the rest of the show .
% uh no more sites at the night safari but in the day time -
we have the morning zoo which is next door .
% uh the morning zoo opens in the day .
and you will be seeing a lot of the mammals .
for example % uh the orang-utans , the chimpanzees .
that can only be seen in the day zoo but not in the night safari .
% uh yes .
because the day zoo , it 's only open in the day and the day , you would n't require the flashlights , right ?
yes .
% uh yes .
you are allowed to take pictures of the animals without flash .
but if you are going to just take your friends and plants or the entrance area % uh then it is fine with the flash .
alright .
so i think % uh we have covered- % uh do you have like % uh you know % uh more or less covered what you think you would like to do in singapore ?
okay , sure .
so we hope to see you % uh soon in % uh singapore .

% uh about five minutes , ten minutes if you walk fast .
% uh if you walks fast it 's five minutes .
% uh your thousand singapore dollars is for your stay and your travel , right ?
% uh huh .
che~ hum . % uh let me see .
hum . % uh let me see .
% uh just hold on a while .
do you mind staying in chinatown ?
yah , this is a- % eh your hotel - % uh the funan centre is in fact within walking distance .
you sound like a young man .
% uh can i just ask what is your age range ?
okay , you can walk then .
% uh i just- was found someone a hotel .
you 're physically able ?
% uh we have many places that are also % uh accessible to people who have difficulty walking .
i 'm gon na show you the hotels in chinatown .
just a minute .
okay .
% uh you were able to get it on the screen now ?
yah , you can see on the left-hand side a list of the hotels ?
correct , yes .
yes , that 's a hundred and forty eight dollars .
but % uh-
yes , a day .
i 'm not sure about that because- anyway around there you can get a lot of % um food .
very reasonably priced food once you step out of the hotel .
if you want to be adventurous and try street food , chinese food by which i think filipino food is quite close , right ?
okay , let me try this other one .
cheap hotels in sngapore .
% uh huh .
% uh no . no , official shangri-la . hundred and twenty five hotels .
there are cheaper hotels than that perhaps .
there you go .
can you see hundred and nineteen dollars ?
okay .
yes .
it 's a good location .
yes , that 's right .
and you could walk to your- funan mall .
you could take a bus maybe two bus stops or one bus stop .
you can walk .
i think for a able-bodied young man you could walk .
maybe ten or fifteen minutes .
fifteen minutes slow walk , okay .
no , you get to see too , right ?
okay , there 's another hotel .
% uh , do you see it ?
oh % uh no not the e~ m and not the- not m and not amara because they 're more for business people .
yes .
% uh lai chun yuen .
trengganu street , yes .
% uh it 's only fifty five dollars , yah .
% uh , yes , that 's right .
the reviews .
% uh , wait .
i 'm losing you now .
% ah it 's better .
this is better .
i will try and get you more on this hotel .
yes .
% uh it- it is a converted % uh shophouse so the buildings you saw were are the exterior .
they 're old buildings , heritage buildings , so the rooms are narrow .
you can see from the picture ?
you get bedroom- yah .
% uh let me see .
they should be air-conditioned .
there it is .
is it with % uh- there 's tea , coffee making , flat screen tv , cable channels , toiletries and hair dryer .
% uh well , it does n't say ac but i think it should be .
i think it's-
yah .
% uh yes , that 's right .
the first word .
% hmm , yes .
yah .
% uh could- % uh i 'm losing you a little bit now .
% uh yes .
% uh like i said about ten minutes or-
% uh slow walk fifteen minutes .
so-
yes , let me see here .
it was about- you can put in a sixty dollars , you know .
% uh just round it up .
yah , round it up .
hotel lai chun yuen .
% uh it is of i think % uh it used to be a chinese opera house if they 're using the name it should be .
since they 're using the name , yah .
% uh the building- original building is pre-war .
yah , pre-war but it- they have all been % um given up by their original owners and restored completely and in the case of the hotels they have been converted into hotels .
so what happens is sometimes they buy up a few units and join them up .
so-
yah , so they- that 's how they get you all the rooms % uh with a on suite bathroom .
yah , the original buildings had one bathroom at the back .
yah .
yes , that 's right .
not a problem at all .
not in singapore anyway .
yah , it says seven point five , you see ?
which is good .
% uh i 'm losing your voice now .
yah , now it 's better .
what is happening over there ?
is your microphone falling off ?
% uh huh .
okay .
what else % uh are you interested in ?
% uh there 's a new museum % uh about three or five minutes walk away % uh and it 's the chinatown % uh heritage museum .
i do n't know if they have a website .
it is interesting because % uh it shows you- but these old buildings were used for long , long ago .
how people lived .
yah , i 'm trying to get it now .
% uh yes .
% uh not chinese history but the way of life in singapore .
alright .
it 's okay .
let me see , huh .
and it 's just , you know , see , this is how the chinese arrived from china and it gives you a very good insight .
you see , these were the conditions .
yah , they take personalities % uh who used to live in that area .
maybe not in the same room but they tell their story in there .
so you can connect the transformation from that kind of room to your hotel room .
same kind of- % uh kind of building .
you know what i mean ?
so it 's % uh- sorry .
chinatown heritage centre , not museum , okay ?
let me see .
i think ten dollars is more than enough .
it does n't say here .
% uh it does n't give the price but let me see , okay .
oh , there , ten dollars , i 'm right .
yah .
and you see here % uh-
sri mariamman temple ?
it 's within walking distance of your hotel .
yes .
so if you want to shop i suggest you- the first one in the museum and then go to funan later .
the shops tend run a little bit later at about ten o'clock .
no , in the morning .
yes .
yah , that 's right .
the museum itself if you 're very interested about- % uh maximum one hour i think .
or forty five minutes .
some people just rush through it because they 're not interested .
but if you really look at things an hour would be more than enough .
yes .
you- % uh i suggest you go round the shops and check the prices and what accessories they give you .
and then you can tell them honestly you 're price checking so they give you good prices and then you can decide where to buy from .
% uh it malls i think that 's the one i know of because i shop there too .
% uh let me try .
% uh we have it fairs in singapore .
if you like crowded shopping you should come during the fair time .
okay , just a minute , huh .
so - we just had one .
yes , the fair .
i think we have now about four times a year .
% ah yah .
% uh it can be very hot in singapore so bring very light clothing .
okay , centigrade about thirty three degrees .
% uh yah .
on a good cool day % uh if it rains maybe twenty eight , twenty nine .
but it will catch up to thirty two .
okay .
okay .
july , no , this one is electronic components .
we have- no these are trade shows .
no , this is not it .
it fairs , open fair .
i put in consumer .
okay .
you can try comex , i think .
yes , comex .
okay , this is in september though .
so what- this one 's over .
% uh huh .
yah .
this one- % uh if you have a look at this one , comex is held at suntec city which is another convention centre but they turned the hall into a big shopping area .
% uh no . % uh when they just- there is a fair it is a specific fair .
so if it 'll be a furniture fair or a food fair or a-
okay .
no . % uh let me- do you want to get into here ?
alright .
are you able to read it ?
gadgets , % hm .
but that is september , right ?
is that right ?
yah , so usually it will be around that time .
you see in march we just had an it show ?
but we have four .
i think september is one of the ones .
anything else you would like to buy in singapore or see ?
yes , that 's right .
yah , that's- if it 's on .
% uh yes , there are shops - there are lots of shops there , you know , to buy clothings , % uh , fashion , other items .
and if-
yah , if you want buy- % uh let me go to- if you want to buy cameras- are you interested in cameras ?
okay .
peninsula shopping centre has many % uh shops selling cameras .
there are different shops .
so again check out the prices there .
% uh i 'm trying to get the shopping centre for you here .
wait % uh . and it 's also near to chinatown .
you could walk or take a bus .
two bus stops away .
yah .
yes .
yes , you see it 's north bridge road .
% uh chinatown is in south bridge road area just separated by the river and you walk a little bit and you 'll reach peninsula plaza .
and you can also eat there and then you can walk to the shops but they haven't- the camera shops have n't put themselves online .
% uh if you come in- on a weekend and you want to meet filipinos and eat filipino food you go to what we called little filipino - little philippines .
% uh it 's actually lucky plaza .
that 's where all the filipinos congregate and so on the fourth and fifth floors % uh we have what si~ shops serving just filipinos .
it's- no , it 's a shopping centre .
a very old one down in orchard road which is the shopping area .
are you getting it on your screen ?
and there are buses from chinatown to orchard road so if you come and you include a sunday on your visit on sunday you go up there and you 'll see lots of filipinos you can get perhaps a better variety of filipino food because sunday is when- well are assumed to be off work , yes .
% uh the whole day you can get lunch , dinner there but you want to eat filipino food in singapore .
% uh i believe there 's a stall at the airport also run by a filipino .
% uh i ca n't remember at which it 's actually at the place where % uh the staff eat .
it 's a staff canteen but you can go there and i used to eat there , filipino food .
% uh huh .
% uh which % uh- is it catholic or % uh-
christian ?
new life christian centre , yes .
i heard of new life .
wait , huh .
new life .
is it called christian-
okay .
i put in singapore and i 'll try and get you the address .
okay , we have new life community church .
can you recognise which one is affiliated to your church ?
oh .
yah .
% uh that is an interesting part of singapore also .
you can do some tasting of chinese food -
% uh there .
and if i 'm not mistaken there 's also a filipino restaurant there % uh because i was there recently and i passed it .
% uh no . this one you need to take a bus % uh because the trains do n't go exactly there .
but it 's an interesting quarter of singapore .
yes .
yes , % um there are food especially to try .
a blend of chinese and malay food and as i said there is a filipino % uh like a café there -
nearby .
so- yah , and it 's at one eight three east coast road .
% uh huh let me see .
number ten east west number thirty two .
% um you see the instructions at the bottom here ?
% uh with an arrow .
op~
yah , i think allow yourself forty five minutes .
but it 's fun to go .
it 's interesting place .
let- just a minute .
let me get the- what is the services .
okay , it 's at eleven thirty a.m .
yes , to be safe .
because on sundays it 's off peak for public transport .
% uh the buses % uh do n't come as frequently as they do during % uh office days and of peak hours .
peak hours they send many more buses in the early mornings and in the evenings when people are going to work and coming back .
so that is why you need to allow time .
but then on the trains it 's only about four minutes or five minutes off peak the most .
usually-
usually about three minutes .
no .
it's- yah , it 's more relaxing on sundays .
yes , smooth , yah .
you could go all the way north and visit the night safari if you want .
or-
% uh it 's a night zoo .
yes , that 's right .
say what are your interest back in philippines ?
what do you like to do ?
beach just to swim , right ?
it 's % uh-
% uh sentosa siloso beach .
okay , i 'm gon na get you a beach in sentosa island .
from your hotel you could go by train and then i 'll get to the train section a little bit later .
% uh , yah .
% uh exactly .
% uh we were told it 's a filipino term for jealousy .
is that right ?
so it is correct , huh ?
% uh i do n't know ho~
% uh no . siloso is just the name of this stretch of the beach on sentosa .
and you could swim there .
there are beach shelters .
you can eat there , you know , % uh there are bistros you could- there are also like ice cream parlors .
things like that .
and we have beach parties also sometimes .
yes , siloso , yes .
or tanjong .
there 's another beach called tanjong beach .
% uh on sentosa .
% uh sentosa island has attractions also but this is just the beach area i 'm showing you .
wait % uh let 's % uh- no % uh let me see .
okay .
they 're both very good .
you see , on the island they have free bus service to bring you so you could go to both beaches .
yah .
and you can take- let me get on the mrt for sentosa .
just a minute , yah .
okay .
this is our mass rapid transit system .
so you come in here .
are you following my mouse ?
see at changi airport ?
yah , and you can go all the way down here .
it 's the east-west line .
and you- and you can connect down to % uh raffles place .
or- you can connect down to- sorry .
city hall .
and then you change to go to dhoby ghaut % uh which is a major interchange and then you take another train you 're down right into chinatown .
beach to chinatown , okay .
sentosa island is here .
can you see harbourfront ?
so from chinatown you just take a train to harbourfront .
yes % uh-
including walking up and down the steps and everything maybe twenty minutes .
the ride itself would be- maybe five minutes , you know .
two and a half minutes , very short .
and then here you take a shuttle into sentosa which is at the bus station within walking distance .
you walk about five minutes and where the public buses stop you can take a sentosa bus in for one dollar .
% um hmm .
yes % uh the bus stops have the entire route for- not the entire route but the route of the buses where they 're going to go .
you just- if you 're taking a public bus you just need to be on the correct side of the road so you can ask anybody at the bus stop .
they 'll be able to tell you .
and % uh when you are at the airport go down to the mrt station and buy a card .
% uh you need to pay a small deposit .
i think it 's about ten dollars or seven dollars which you get back % uh when you go back home .
and maybe there 's a small charge for making the card , you know , just a nominal fee .
but the deposit- you put extra deposit is for your travel fare so you do n't have to worry about carrying the correct amount of money .
% uh yes .
at the it shops % uh i think they would accept .
at the major stores they would accept , yes .
if you pay it on the streets in chinatown if you buy souvenir say three souvenirs for ten dollars then they would not accept .
yah , you need some cash .
you might want to change it when you arrive at the airport .
the rates are quite decent .
so- that - if you are staying just two days there 's no point hunting for a money changer who usually gives a slightly better rate .
yes .
yes , you can change at the airport and then go to the basement where the mrts which stands for mass rapid transit .
% uh get your travel card .
so once you 've got your local money you can buy your travel card and they will supply you a map .
at least they used to a map and they can both also be very informative .
about how to travel , you know , if you 're not sure there they will give you very good directions .
nature-re~ % uh related .
one of my best % uh places is this place and you should bring your binoculars if you 're going .
but there are also places that you can just do a walk .
% uh this one you have to travel because it 's in the north and you are in the south of singapore .
yes , sungei buloh .
it means bamboo river .
no sungei is a river and buloh is river .
% uh sorry .
buloh is bamboo and- so river bamboo .
yah .
if you go at low tide or even high tide you can see mudskipper - % uh you can see a % uh tree climbing crabs .
if you come in december you can see migratory birds .
% uh that fly from % um % uh- as far away as mongolia and some continue to perth .
now , let me see .
you can take a train up to kranji .
kranji is where it 's located .
and then you take this bus called the kranji express .
can you see this ?
yah .
so at the kranji when you get out of the train you come out on the road you wait for this bus and you pay him three dollars for a two-way transfer .
he 'll give you a ticket .
so- yah .
so when you 're at sungei buloh check out the times that they leave sungei buloh back to the station so you can time yourself on your walk .
buloh~ sungei buloh .
wet~ wetland reserve .
then- or you can continue on the bus and just visit other places .
this is just some of them that he will drop you .
% uh it 's a gardenasia .
i think it 's a nursery .
% uh bollywood is also nursery .
hay dairies they have got goats from all over the world .
yes .
% uh if you want to watch migratory birds in december then- oh anyway from september to march then you need like half a day or one day there .
no . % uh they will be there but the thing is you might enjoy it and walk around and there are trails over the % uh marine life and trails over % uh ponds % uh in there .
so if you 're a birder , a twitter , they may normally spend half a day there .
but if you just want to see then you can continue on the bus and visit the rest of the places .
% uh we have attractions % uh if you want like the bird park .
yes .
we have the jurong bird park .
if you are lazy to % uh look at birds , you know , through your binoculars you want them in your face-
jurong bird park .
and you can see them- there you can have them flying right in front of you .
yah .
so- % uh this one is not so wild because it 's an attraction but sungei buloh is wild .
it 's re~
okay .
if you want more information on wild places % uh you- when you come in to singapore you might want to contact someone from % uh nature society and we have nature guides there .
or they-
they are the more hardcore people , you know .
hardcore .
you want to-
really wild % uh-
% uh it 's a- yes , but there are guides in there that can help you .
or like you can see horseshoe crab .
so just remember this % uh website when you come and see .
and there are public walks that you can join .
yah .
yes .
so the- this is focused on wilderness whereas places like the zoo and the bird park is more attractive , you know , for tourists who do n't want to get too muddy or dirty or-
of % um-
% uh you should walk % uh at traffic light junctions and , you know , you should walk carefully .
do n't jaywalk .
% uh it 's actually for your own safety because the traffic can be , you know , % uh they follow traffic rules but people are used to people not walking when the lights are red so you should just follow the rules there .
% uh not to litter .
% uh yah , you can bring in gum to chew if you need to chew gum but just do n't bring in great quantities because you 're not allowed to import chewing gum .
% uh you can chew it but you ca n't import it because if you stick the gum in the wrong place you can stop the trains from moving .
you know what i mean ?
that 's why we have the rule because % uh if there 's no total contact the doors do n't shut properly the trains get stuck .
so we ca n't afford to have people chewing gum .
also dirtying the place .
yah .
if you 're in a place of worship % uh it 's better not to photograph people .
% uh and maybe you want to ask the temple people before you do the photographing .
if you 're photographing the architecture like the statues % uh the facade that's-
quite alright .
yah , that's-
that 's okay .
and in the airport i do n't think they want you to use your camera .
we have all religions in singapore % uh but % um as the majority three quarters of us are chinese .
the buddhism and taoism is very % uh visible in singapore .
in fact , within walking distance of your hotel there is a fairly new buddhist temple and it 's huge .
% uh i propose you visit another one that is further away .
% uh you can walk too but it 's not so near as this new temple .
yes .
that 's % uh- this one .
okay , here it is .
telok ayer street is just one street away from where you are .
it's- thian hock keng .
% uh that 's what we call it .
unfortunately , the street name is also- this name is chinese dialect .
the street name is telok ayer street which is-
yah , which is water bay street .
can you see here ?
it means water bay street .
yes .
and % uh if you go there you allow some time to visit % uh mosque , % hm- two doors away from it .
it 's just been newly renovated again but it 's about as old as this temple .
this temple actually dates from the eighteen twenties when it was a little shrine .
so it 's one of the oldest in singapore .
% uh no . i 'm afraid it 's a bit more like a tourist attraction except on feast days .
% uh the one way you get to see a lot of monks is the one very near % uh buddha tooth relic .
buddha tooth relic .
this is also a good-
this one is strictly buddhist .
yah .
thian hock keng is a buddhist and taoist so you get a lot of other deities that are common to both religions but here you get mostly buddha .
this is south bridge road .
yes , sorry ?
% uh i think you ask whoever looks like a monk in there first before you take the photograph .
yah , so as not to offend them , it would be a bit better .
yes , they might if you look very obviously like a tourist .
okay .
can i show you the- these photos here ?
okay .
there it is .
so this is grander looking .
it 's new % uh , you see ?
yes .
this one is just a few years old but the other one it has been restored but % uh the last time i went about a month ago they are still restoring parts of it so maybe the back you ca n't go .
yes , you can go inside .
% uh make sure you use the side door .
the there are doors in the centre and doors to the left and right of the centre .
use the side doors .
yah , the main door is for the temple priest to go in .
there's- there 's another one .
% uh that is- this one is also in chinatown and it 's a heritage temple .
okay .
no .
no , but-
no . % uh but here the tem~ % uh the sri mariamman if you use your camera inside they 'll ask you for a camera fees .
just a few dollars .
the those are statues so it 's very spectacular for % uh photography .
very colourful % uh .
it 's hindu .
this is hindu .
you see this picture here ?
and this is very- % uh this is- has a very authentic view because people are still % uh praying here they 're worshiping here so you should go in the morning before twelve .
yes .
they close from about twelve to about four , four thirty .
they have a short break and then they re-open in the evening .
so either that or you go in the evening .
yes , if you want to use your camera you get better light also .
% uh they have a small door open you can get in but inside there 's no activity , there 's nobody praying , you know , it's- the temple priests are not around .
yah .
right .
okay .
anything else ?
i 'm losing you .
% uh huh .
yes .
now it 's better .
you 're most welcome , jes .
hope to see you .
bye bye .
yah .
bye .
yah .
hi , good morning-
% uh good afternoon .
this is % uh tour guide one .
lynnette here .
and can i have your name please ?
okay , and how can i help you ?
okay .
% uh which part of the year are you planning to come ?
okay .
and how many people are coming with you ?
okay and ha- % uh okay , what do you and your friends like to do ?
% uh sorry , i did n't get you .
the last one , what did you say ?
okay .
so % uh you like to see culture , history -
and % uh places ?
places ?
okay .
okay , so % uh for the culture-wise .
singapore has a few culture .
so we have like the chinese culture .
% uh yes .
for the culture side , we have % uh the chinese culture .
we have the malay .
arab culture .
we also have the indian culture .
so which one should i introduce you first ?
the chinese culture .
okay .
i would like to introduce you to the chinatown % uh of singapore .
okay , i 'm just going to show you , this is just one picture of chinatown .
% ah yes .
there are souvenirs available but they will be all % uh chinese related kind of souvenir .
so this is just one street scene in chinatown .
alright .
i 'm going to show you .
yah , this is just a street scene in chinatown .
and then when the people in the past come to singapore .
% uh they all live near the singapore river .
so chinatown is actually just next to the singapore river .
their houses , you could see are more elaborate .
they have % uh these carvings .
alright , some of these houses have carvings outside their houses .
% uh and it will be a little bit different from the other culture .
alright .
okay .
more- most of these chinatown houses , i would say they are in the range of about a hundred twenty years now .
they were- yah , they we 're built in the early nineteen hundreds .
so the different- and the chinese are also divided into various dialect speaking .
okay .
dialects are spoken languages .
yah .
% uh languages will be both spoken and written .
so % uh dialect meaning it 's just spoken language .
so this people , they came from china and they live in % uh various so-called % uh provinces in china .
and they speak different dialect .
so when they come here % uh not every one of them would speak mandarin .
so they will still be just speaking in their % uh dialects .
alright .
so when they came here , they still live in different street % uh in singapore .
% uh i would say it 's a popular spot for tourist to visit .
if you want to learn , to see the chinese % um houses .
% uh where do the chinese % uh used to live % uh in the past .
and there are some pictures on your right-hand side .
these are just some old photograph of % uh chinatown .
okay . this is actually % uh a bullock cart .
okay . this is actually % uh a bullock cart .
yah , in the past , they do n't have % uh motor vehicles .
motor vehicles came later part of the years .
so they started using bullock cart to transport their goods .
% uh and % uh yah , mainly for transportation of goods .
for people , they would be using the trishaws .
it 's a three-wheel vehicle .
% uh so this is the scene % uh what you can see in chinatown .
and you also mentioned about history , right ?
okay .
% uh do you want me to introduce you to % uh a museum in chinatown ?
okay .
okay .
we have a museum in chinatown and % uh this museum is called the chinatown heritage centre .
% uh there is no show but there are some % uh tv programmes that you can stop to see .
it is not a very big museum .
okay , so- % uh no culture show for this % uh museum .
it is housed inside a shop house .
okay , so you can see the layout of the first level .
okay .
and the second level .
okay , and the third level .
alright .
yes .
there are no escalators .
there 's only a lift but the lift is quite small .
yah .
so you are young , right ?
so you should be okay .
so it 's accessible by the mrt .
okay .
so these are just some of the things that you 'll be looking at inside the % uh- % uh inside the % uh museum .
okay .
yes .
% uh ancestors of singaporeans .
okay .
% uh in the beginning % uh there were actually some native singaporeans who live here .
alright .
% uh there were about thousand of them .
and % uh we do have % uh- back in the past , we were actually part of the mahajapit forces based in indonesia .
yes .
yes .
and % uh well , things were going fine .
we had kings to rule us .
they were about five of them .
% uh kings , yes .
there were kings in singapore .
alright .
% uh the first king of singapore is called sang nila utama .
yes .
and he % uh named us singapura from temasek he renamed us as singapura % uh and that 's how singapore gets its name .
alright .
now the last king of singapore , because he was pursued by his % uh enemies .
and he went over to melaka setup and other kingdom there .
so we do not have any more kings here .
alright .
and so it was pretty quiet out here again until the year of eighteen nineteen when raffles came to singapore .
so when he came here , we have approximately about a thousand people living here .
it 's the- % uh raffles is from % uh britain .
yes , he 's a european .
so he came here because he was % uh working for the british east india company .
alright .
now , when he came here , later on he decided to make singapore into a free port .
so from then on , many people from all over the world started to come here .
yes , for trade and business .
and to seek for employment as well .
% uh so there are people from all over the world coming here .
for example , we have people from the nearby malay archipelago area .
okay .
so the malay archipelago , we will be talking about the indonesian % uh islands .
alright .
we are talking about % uh malaysia .
malaya at that time .
% uh we are % uh- so basically nearby to singapore , we call this the malay archipelago .
yah .
and we also have people coming from china .
alright .
we also have people coming from europe .
and we have people coming from the arab countries .
so the main group of people would be from these countries .
% uh yes .
so singapore is now multi-racial .
because of our history .
okay .
% uh buddha relic temple ?
okay .
that is in chinatown .
yes .
so there are a lot of things to do in chinatown .
% uh the buddha relic temple is just located in chinatown .
and you could do those temple when you are going down to chinatown .
alright .
so i 'm going to show you again the image of the buddha relic temple .
% uh yes .
this is all % uh built % uh just in chinatown itself .
chinatown has a few lanes .
alright , it 's not just one street .
so it 's actually consists of quite a number of lanes .
% uh and one of the attractions % uh you are thinking of visiting is this buddha relic temple .
you can walk inside but there is a dress code .
% uh dress code , you will have to be appropriately dressed .
for example % uh no like shorts .
cute like i mean , sorry , % uh cargo pants % uh just will be fine .
% uh singlet of course is not appropriate % uh dress code for % uh visiting any places of worship here .
oh yes .
there are local people who goes in % uh to do their prayers % uh during the opening hours of the temple .
% uh so % uh you will see , yes , worshippers going in to worship .
but otherwise % uh most of the time in % uh chinese temples % uh it will be more crowded when % uh- like on special days .
% uh the first day and the fifteenth day of the chinese calendar which is different from the western calendar .
okay .
and of course during the buddha .
% uh the buddha % uh birthday .
yes , you will find that % uh more people would be worshiping % uh otherwise it 's % uh- well that is- it 's not that crowded to visit the buddha relic temple .
quite a walk .
% uh if you are thinking of taking the mrt , it is just about three lanes away .
yah .
yah but it 's okay .
yes .
so % uh i think % uh it again depends on whether you want to visit % um % uh it 's it all depends whether you want to visit the chinatown heritage centre .
if you were planning to do that , then you have to allocate about one hour in the- at chinatown heritage centre or minimum forty minutes i would say .
the buddha relic temple approximately % uh twenty minutes .
yes .
% uh walk through some of the lanes probably would take you about % uh one and a half hours .
so well , you can spend easily half a day just doing % uh these few places .
yes .
yes , that 's right .
so do you want to eat some % uh chinese food in chinatown ?
okay .
do you want to go to a restaurant ?
or you want to do just % uh non-air conditioned food places ?
sorry .
restaurants ?
okay .
% uh do you know this food called chinese dim sum ?
okay .
yah .
so these are just some % uh like % uh small little food and they normally steam them in a bamboo container .
otherwise you- there are also some dishes that is fried .
% uh so that would be something that you can get % uh in chinatown .
alright , chinese dim sum in-
chinatown huh .
yes .
okay .
night life in singapore , i would like to recommend you to this- are you talking about clubs ?
are you talking about clubs ?
okay , we have a very famous club .
% uh yes . the-
% uh yes . the- especially the younger people and the young at heart .
okay , we have a very famous % uh club in singapore and we call it zouk .
yah .
have you heard of this name before ?
have you heard of this club ?
it 's very famous .
okay , these are just some of the scene % uh in the club .
as you can see it 's very crowded .
alright .
so this-
yes , so these are- lots of beautiful people over there to see and to be seen and party .
alright .
so this is one of them .
% uh the night scene .
okay .
oh okay .
now our % uh hours- our party hours % uh we properly finish around three a.m .
where is- it does n't go through throughout the night .
okay , so this is one of the clubs that you may want to visit .
alright .
yah , it 's a very famous club in singapore .
okay .
alright .
now , you will have to % uh take a mrt .
alright .
and the closest mrt stop for you would be at this station called the % uh tiong bahru mrt train station .
yes .
% uh this is on the west line .
okay .
assuming that your hotel is located somewhere in % uh orchard road .
% uh it will take you approximately- % uh it 's actually quite nearby but because there 's no direct line from orchard road so you will have to % uh plan about % uh twenty minutes .
yes .
because you will have to change line .
okay .
so another % uh so the dress code , do you need to tell- to % uh- do you need me to tell you about dress code ?
okay , it will be party wear .
i mean % uh night % uh clubs outfit .
yah .
okay .
so you understand what i mean , right ?
okay , another- yes ?
% uh yes .
okay , another % uh club that i would like to introduce you would be this one that i 'm going to show you now .
this is quite a few clubs in there .
it 's called saint james power station .
yah .
yes .
there are few % uh different kind of clubs that you can see % uh in this power station .
it 's not used as a power station anymore .
there are clubs in there .
so you have different themes in this % uh park so you can hop from one to the other .
yah .
so- % uh yah , what i mean is you can go- if you do n't like this club , you can go till then move on to the next one and the next one .
alright .
so this is in saint james power station .
yes .
gadget ?
% uh what sort of gadgets are you talking about ?
% uh computers , laptop , so on and so forth ?
okay .
now this is one % uh % uh shopping complex % uh that you can % uh visit .
it 's called funan digilife or funan it mall .
okay , this is the funan it mall .
yes .
the location is just near the- it 's about seven minutes ' walk from city hall mrt .
yes .
it 's quite convenient to ride the mrt % uh in singapore .
so % uh like i mentioned , this is near the city hall mrt train station .
oh and yes , we have n't % uh introduced you to any hotel yet .
okay .
so the it mall , there are a number about five levels of shopping .
and these % uh every other shop sells it related products .
for example from cameras right up to laptops to accessories % uh can be found in this mall .
yes .
% uh yeah .
and it 's all % uh it related products in there .
so you can spend- up to you , you know , the- how many hours you take to find % uh the product that you wanted to buy .
okay .
for the hotels in singapore , they have various % uh ranges % uh in terms of price range .
so we have % uh let 's say the three to the four star hotels % uh ranges from about hundred and fifty % uh onwards to about two hundred .
% uh and of course we have the three hundred to four hundred range and four hundred and above .
or even the % uh what you call the value hotels , the budget hotels .
okay .
alright .
so- okay , i can give you these budget hotels .
okay .
these are some of the budget hotels that we have in singapore .
okay % uh one of the companies that runs these ho- budget hotels is called % uh hotel eighty one .
okay .
yes .
and they are pretty small hotel .
i mean the rooms are pretty small .
% um okay .
so this is nearer for you dickson or chinatown .
okay .
there 's also this budget hotel in chinatown .
% uh no . it 's actually right in the heart of chinatown .
but just bear in mind , the rooms are not that big .
okay .
yah .
so these are-
yah .
so price range would be in the region of about a hundred and fifty .
price range .
okay .
so these are just some pictures of the-
% uh budget hotels .
yah .
so there are few % uh budget hotels located in orchard road .
even this one at beach road .
yes .
orchard , o r c h a- orchard road , yah .
so quite a lot of hotels are located along orchard road .
but of course if you choose to live further away , there are also hotels available .
but because you are going to spend just a few days here so i would recommend that you stay closer % um around chinatown .
that 's one at beach road .
you can stay in this % uh beach road area as well .
okay .
and this one , it 's also okay .
hotel grand chancellor .
okay .
but if you want to stay in orchard road , there are also other hotels out there as well .
alright .
okay .
would you want to consider backpackers ?
you like % uh backpackers hotel ?
okay , we have backpackers hotel .
just now we mentioned about you like history , right ?
okay .
can i recommend you one hotel , budget hotel ?
% uh that is located just right in the heart of another cultural area .
and this one- yah , this is called sleepy sam .
% uh just now i mentioned about the budget hotel like hotel eighty one .
that 's one in chinatown .
okay .
so you also mentioned about you like history .
so we already talked about chinatown .
so that is the chinese area .
yah .
so now i can recommend you an- % uh this is actually a backpackers ' hotel and it 's located in another cultural place called kampong glam .
okay .
kampong is a malay word , it means village and glam is actually named after glam trees .
so there used to be a lot of glam trees that 's found in this kampong but no longer now .
we only have a few of this glum tree that 's left .
% uh this is the location of the % uh sleepy sam .
alright .
and the- it 's % uh also near the mrt called bugis .
so it will be a different kind of location from the chinatown budget hotel .
this one would be % uh in the so-called malay and the arab quarters .
yes .
okay .
% uh it all depends .
you can go to the guides online and you can call up the guides if you want to do a half-day tour .
% uh the charges depends , alright , on the guide .
% uh normally % uh the guides will charge like let 's say % uh in the range of- from- for one person , two person , it does n't matter .
okay , from the range of let 's say- because this would be like a private basis or small group of people .
% um and if you are just talking about % uh walking tours % uh that- they will charge probably in the range of twenty five dollars per hour .
yes , approximately .
yes .
yes .
so that would be about % uh- no , i mean like i said , it does n't matter how many of you .
% uh it's- so yah , so approximately about twenty five dollars per hour .
yah .
okay , otherwise you can walk around on your own % uh if you choose to stay in sleepy sam .
% uh you are in the malay quarters so this is kampong glam and % uh kampong glam , as you can see from the left-hand side of-
the % uh picture .
there is a picture of a mosque and this is called the sultan mosque .
this picture will show you a street scene in % uh kampong glam .
% uh over here , of course , it 's used to be the malay quarters .
you will find malay cuisine out here .
% uh yes .
so malay cuisines are a little bit more spicy food compared to the chinese food .
and do you want me to introduce you to some malay food ?
alright .
the malay food % uh compared to the chinese will be more spicy .
so we have like simple dishes called mee siam .
mee siam is actually the small thin white noodles .
% um and we put in a sour kind of a sauce % uh together with this- with a hard-boiled egg .
% um so this is % uh % um mee siam .
alright .
% uh a little bit spicy . it 's a little bit sour and spicy .
% uh a little bit spicy . it 's a little bit sour and spicy .
% uh this is % um mee siam .
alright .
otherwise we do have also % uh another malay food called % uh mee soto .
okay , mee siam - mee soto , it 's a noodles with- cooked in % um chicken straps .
with a little bit of soup .
% um not that spicy , just a tinge of spice .
% uh okay , so this will be malay food .
alright .
okay , sure .
and there are also some % uh restaurants in % uh kampong glam .
alright .
% uh and they serve % uh rice with dishes .
we call it the nasi padang .
yes .
nasi is % um a malay word , it means rice .
okay , and you get to choose your dishes in % uh to go with your rice .
yes , you get your rice and % uh you have this % uh dishes like for example , fried chicken % uh vegetables but of course they are spicy .
usually they are spicy .
% um and % uh so that is % uh malay food , yah , in % uh in kampong glam , nasi padang .
okay .
and also you can have another malay food called % uh satay .
okay , this food is % um % uh marinated meat .
you can have % uh chicken % uh mutton % uh marinated and they pierce through a skewer and it 's barbecued over charcoal and you dip them with a peanut sauce % uh spicy peanut sauce .
so that is another very typical % uh malay food in % uh where you can % uh find in % uh singapore .
alright , so this is malay food .
% uh the other- and you can also even get indonesian cuisine % uh over in kampong glam .
okay .
so you have this like a smashed % uh chicken with rice .
we call it ayam penyet .
% uh that is-
yes , that you can also find in kampong glam as well as in other parts of singapore .
% uh in kampong glam itself ?
okay .
there are % uh mid-eastern % uh cuisine that you can find in % uh kampong glam .
egyptian-
turkish .
% uh even mediterranean and there 's even a swedish cafe % uh that 's found in kampong glam .
% uh but in kampong glam , mainly it will be malay cuisine and indonesian i would say .
yah .
but like i said , there are some arabic % uh egyptian and turkish % uh restaurants that 's found in kampong glam itself .
would you want to pay a visit to the mosque ?
okay .
so again- yes , you ca- you are permitted to enter the sultan mosque in kampong glam .
yes .
% uh yes .
it is a living mosque so yes , people do visit the mosque to pray .
% uh the mosque will be crowded in the afternoon % uh on friday .
yes .
% uh on other days % uh that would be fine .
but on friday % uh they would not want to admit any % uh visitors % uh because they are going to have their prayers , the congregational prayers on friday .
alright .
so you are coming on the fourteenth , it 's fine .
fourteenth of may is actually monday .
% uh yes .
% uh all the places of worship % uh would have a dress code .
so again % um % uh pants must be below the knee .
% uh shorts or t-shirts % uh with the shoulders covered .
% uh otherwise if you are not so % uh properly dressed % uh the- % uh sultan mosque will provide a cloth % uh for people to wear tourists to put over their clothes % uh if they are not properly % uh covered up .
% uh there is no admission to visit the % uh sultan mosque .
% uh but if you are non-muslim % uh then we would not encourage you or we would % uh ask you to refrain from getting into the prayer hall .
okay .
so that is % uh the other- second culture that we 're talking about % uh in singapore .
okay , we have another culture called the indians .
alright .
so traditionally % uh these ethnic areas are where people used to live in the past .
the various ethnic area .
% uh so okay .
so this little india again , it is accessible by the subway .
yes .
little india in singapore .
okay .
i 'm gon na show you some of the images here .
i think it 's not-
yah , okay .
this is % uh one of the street scene in % uh little india .
% uh which period of time they are built ?
% uh the year that they were built , is it ?
okay .
now little india % uh would be in the range of about a hundred years old because they % uh came a bit later after the chinese quarters .
it 's member- % uh when everybody came here , they live in chinatown area .
and it was very crowded so people started moving away .
so they would be in the range of about a hundred years % uh for little india .
okay , these % uh vehicles , we call them the trishaws .
they are three-wheeled vehicles .
you do n't see % uh them plying % um the other parts of the street- % uh other parts of singapore because they have designated % uh trishaws stations that these trishaws can park .
so it 's not going to be very easy for you to flag a taxi % uh for example on an % um on other roads in singapore .
would you be interested to get on one ?
these are just used for sightseeing purposes .
% uh like i mentioned , the trishaw men can only ride on designated % uh roads in singapore .
so you can not tell him % uh i want to % uh go to changi airport , then that 's not possible .
alright .
yah .
so designated area around the chinatown or the % um % uh at
yah , little in- yah , i 'm sorry .
% uh little india area % um as well as around the padang area , that 's about it for the trishaw ride .
so these were now used for sightseeing % uh purposes .
and you have to get to the trishaw station % uh to get on to these trishaws .
yes .
% uh the station % uh is % um located near bugis % uh and you can see the trishaw there .
yes .
yes .
yes , so % uh i have introduced you- to you three of our main cultures % uh that we have here .
alright .
we do have actually one more culture .
yah we do have one more culture .
% uh yes .
and that is located in the eastern part of singapore .
we call them the peranakans .
okay .
% uh yah .
nearby to one another ?
yes , they are quite near to one another .
% uh in the sense that % uh it 's just about less than half an hour from one another % uh taking the mrt .
yah .
so you would be able to get from one place to another within half an hour if you 're going to use the mrt .
yah .
so the next % uh culture i 'm going to introduce to you would be- it 's easy for you to get to the museum called the peranakan museum .
again , this is just near city hall mrt .
and this group of people were originally chinese people .
but % uh what they have done is % uh we call them the straits borns so when they came to singapore , the men first came and they inter-married with the local non-malay lady- % uh the local % uh non-muslim ladies .
and with it , finally they evolved their own culture called the peranakans .
the men .
yes , the men came from china and they inter-married with the local-
non-muslim ladies .
yah , so this is a traditional dress .
we call them- just now those ladies , they are wearing their kebayas .
very beautiful clothes .
so this will be the peranakan museum .
sorry ?
% uh no . for the museum , it 's okay .
you can just go .
% uh no strict dress code .
% uh but of course , you know % uh no swimming attire .
yes , you can wear shorts % uh if you want to go to the museum .
that 's fine .
% uh most of the time there will be no cultural show .
% uh but at % uh let 's say certain events , yes , can- % uh there may be a show or a tour % uh for the museum otherwise % uh no . for the time of may % uh no , we do n't have like any special % uh events that 's going to come out .
let 's see any upcoming % um-
% uh october , what do you mean ?
sorry ?
% uh no . it all depends on % uh whether- i 'm talking about % uh event- % uh the museum would be on-going .
alright .
let 's see .
i do n't think there 's any special events coming out in % uh may .
let 's see may .
any special events .
okay .
we 'll have to see .
usually % uh during school holidays , the museum have some % uh special events that 's played .
yes .
okay .
okay for the may thirteen , i guess you have not arrived .
yah , this one is- it 's for the children .
they have this make a bouquet of flower , paper flowers % uh with % uh peranakan motif .
alright oh that will be for mother 's day .
yah , and otherwise the next event will be in june .
% uh yah .
because that would be the june school holidays in singapore .
so otherwise the museum , it 's very nice to visit .
% uh lots of things to see , very different % uh culture from the other two cultures that i 'm talking about .
okay .
so let 's see any- there are- i think there 's no special % uh events in the month of may except % uh for may the thirteenth where they have this children 's workshop for mother 's day .
yah .
then yes , otherwise the on-going % uh exhibition will always be on-going so we always have the current % uh exhibition .
okay .
so you will always see the current exhibitions and that 's always on-going .
yes .
% uh yes , we have % uh the kebaya collection .
but this one will end in eight of april .
you will still see some % uh small collection of kebayas .
% uh that 's the traditional clothes of the peranakans .
you will see a lot of % uh cutlery % uh crockery that were used by the peranakan which is very different from the other two culture .
% uh and of course , you see like wedding % uh rituals % uh what do the peranakans do ?
% uh even in % uh death as well , funeral % um % uh yah , rituals .
% uh what do the peranakans do ?
how do their house look like ?
so basically that 's what you 're going to see in the peranakan museum .
it 's a very beautiful % uh very colourful % uh museum .
okay .
okay , because they were originally chinese men and they inter-married with local non-malay- % uh non-muslim ladies .
so they are still very much % uh traditionally .
% uh they are still very much % uh buddhist .
but % uh along the way , quite a number of them had converted to christianity .
so they actually mix % uh in their house , the traditional one .
% uh you still see chinese altars % uh in the house .
yes .
okay , sure .
yah .
same to you and thanks for calling in .
alright .
okay .
bye .
hello .
hello .
good afternoon .
hi elai i 'm jeanne .
hi .
how are you ?
how can i help you ?
% uh how many days are you intending to spend in singapore ?
three day
three or two days ?
% uh i think three days may be a bit better .
two days is just one night , you know ?
yah .
% uh do you have any dates or is it still open ?
seventh to ninth .
easter .
is it easter ?
% oh okay .
% um , who are you travelling with ?
okay .
is a guy like you ?
and i presume you are in your twenthies you sound young .
okay .
and your friend is ?
% oh just a backpack .
okay .
okay .
and % eh what are your interest ?
okay .
you would- do you have a particular subject ?
is it people or you also take sceenery and animals ?
okay , scenery .
% uh people also ?
culture .
like-
architecture ?
like buildings .
nature , okay .
% uh how about animals ?
okay .
i 'm going to recommend- firstly you want to have a backpack type of hotel , right ?
okay .
let me get you -
so you do n't mind if it 's a bit % uh not so roomy like hotel because you just back to sleep .
okay , % um-
let 's try this one , okay ?
is the inncrowd backpackers hostel in singapore .
but % uh you are looking for a room , right ?
you are not looking for a bed ?
yah , we do have backpackers joints were you get % uh only a bed if you like include six to eight people in a room .
so there are different categories .
and then you save a lot of money , huh ?
.
that 's right , eating .
you 'll have a heaven here for eating .
you can eat a lot of food , a lot of % um-
% uh so you could eat street food ?
okay .
okay .
okay , this is very colourful for you two guys .
% uh this is in little india .
and % uh can you see the rates on your screen ?
if you take a dorm bed per person only twenty dollars .
if you take a room , it 's two single beds at fifty nine dollars .
and that would be fifty nine for two beds .
yah , the prices are based on per person per bed or dorm .
but this one is room .
so it should be fifty nine for the two room .
so you 're actually paying about ten dollars more per person only .
yes .
little india has got two tran stations - two stops .
they are actually quite close to each other .
that 's little india stop and the farrer park stop .
and your hotel would be in that vicinity .
so you see you get here , you get breakfast , dinner .
that means you get your towel , you got a locker and internet access .
yes .
if you take a bit more luxurious a double room , a double bed and a single bed .
that means one of you sleeps in a bigger bed .
it 's that 's fifty nine dollars .
that would be for three people i think .
% uh no . but you can get there easily by taking the trains % uh from the airport .
you just need to make a change in the train direction .
if you went for example all the way to chinatown so you will have to cha~ take a change of trains .
okay , i'm- yes .
% uh it 's actually at the basement the airport .
and that is the first thing you should do when you arrive .
% uh change some local money and then % uh you take the train .
% uh you buy the card first .
you buy the card and % ah you pay a deposit .
you put money into the card then after that you do n't have to worry about having enough change to % uh pay the fare .
yes , you can use the card % uh-
that 's right .
as long as you got money in it % uh you will get a card .
so it 's not a problem .
and % uh % um waiting for it to download the map .
let me see .
okay , it 's coming on now .
good .
okay .
then i can show you % uh the location of your hotel and in relation to where the airport is .
okay , if you look on the right-hand side of the sccren , can you see changi airport at the bottom right-hand where number three is ?
so- chang~ that is right .
so when you reach the airport you go down to the basement .
% uh this would be the airport terminals conduc~ connecting terminals one , two , and three .
if you are at a budget hotel - % uh budget airport , you have to take a shuttle to the main airport and then go to the bus stat~ to the % um train station and-
no , it 's between the airport but it 's easier to just take the shuttle .
it 's a free shuttle that runs bet~
yah .
so you get your ticket , you pay your deposit .
and i think at the airport they gave you a map .
and- to give you an idea .
so all this is free .
and then you travel along the east line towards the west .
can you see tanah merah on the second stop ?
okay .
so that is where you change to go down to town to the west towards the west .
and you go down to- just give me a minute .
to % uh , i think the easiest way is to go to outram park .
can you see where it goes all the way down and it curves up a little bit ?
yah .
yes .
o u r t - o u t r -
alright .
so when you get up there , you take the line towards little india .
so it 's one , two , three stops and you are at little india .
so this is the place that you can go out and try street food you can soak in the atmosphere .
you would love taking your camera out because you can photograph the indian garland makers , the fortune tellers .
% uh it 's full of life and culture .
it 's one of my favourite places .
yes .
so there are hindu temples there .
you can photograph beautiful architecture and statues of the different deities , the hindu deities .
okay .
yes .
okay , little india if you are visiting the temples , you avoid from about twelve noon to four o'clock , they have a break .
so you go early morning or you go in the evening .
and then chinatown you take the same line .
can you see chinatown ?
two , three stops down ?
so you 'll get off at chinatown , you are right in the heart of chinatown .
and in chinatown we have % uh also bhuddist temple and terrace temple also great for photography .
not vietnamese but there is % uh kampong glam which you have to go by bus because- well actually you could go by train because you are young and healthy you can walk .
% uh go-
you go to % um , city hall station .
so let 's say you are at little india , you got ta run to dhoby ghaut .
can you see dhoby ghaut ?
yah , just one stop % uh towards the south .
and then you take the red line which is called the circle line and you get just one stop at city hall station .
and when you get off , ask the direction to beach road .
so not only do you walk towards the malay quarter or rather the historic % uh , quarter for the malays the malays have mainly moved out from there .
but there 's a beautiful mosque there and on the way you will pass raffles hotel which is a historic hotel and also a consolation buidling .
% uh do you like barhopping % uh or just- you still want to walk around , stroll around and take in the sights .
% uh , you can- yes , very safe .
% um , you do n't just flash go chains around your neck , you 'll be okay .
it 's quite safe .
no curfew .
we have n't heard of one for a long time .
% um most singaporean 's will not know what you mean when you say curfew .
yah , no problem .
% uh no problem at all .
so if you take your train like little india you would take the train to dhoby ghaut , you take the circle line down , and you go down to marina bay .
that 's a very scenic area by the river and you could walk around there and you- if you want the bus , you go down to clarke quay .
just clarke quay there ?
and we- it 's not shown on the map but we have a river there and you could go barhopping , you could eat , you could pick-up some girls .
% ah okay .
but you meet a lot of people there that you know , they will might just talk to you if they are tourists .
yes .
yah , that is really good .
% uh another place say , okay , the next day i~ or if you want to go to attractions to take photos % ah of animals , you- i suggest you go through the % uh wildlife safari 's park % uh which you can also reach by train and by bus .
yah .
% uh it 's more- it 's also easter for the catholics and the christians in singapore .
so you might want to go to midnight mass .
% uh , i do n't know whether the priest will be happy if you are using your flash taking photos .
but % uh in the day the churches are very beautiful to photograph .
they are not decorated but % uh , you will be able to photograph them .
yes , so % uh there are two places i want to suggest to you one is the natural wildlife area .
it 's called sungei buloh wetland reserve and there you can capture birds and crabs % uh , monitor lizards , crabs climbing trees
and got- % uh yes .
it 's all natural .
so once i bought a friend and he caughts a- got a photograph of a monitor lizard eating a fish .
so it 's trail fo~
yes , they are all wild and they are protected there .
so for bird photography is very good .
% uh and if you are really into bird photography it 's from about september to april .
actually if you come now right away you can still catch some brids , % uh that are coming from mongolia .
so , you know , they are migratory birds .
okay , from your hotel - i do n't have the map now but you connect with the % uh northbound line .
sorry , the westbound line and you go all the way to kranji and then you take a bus .
% uh you see the kranji express here ?
you pay three dollars as an adult and you get a ticket which you can use for your return journey .
so-
.
from you hotel to here may be about 50 minutes or so f you plan it correctly .
so you look at the train timing .
% uh you see the first line , kranji ?
that 's when the bus arrives to pick-up people .
so if you miss the nine o'clock , the next one is ten-fifteen .
but the alternative is if you miss this you take the public bus and then you have to walk about half a kilometre from where the bus stops to the reserve .
if you take this bus , it drops you right outside .
% uh , entrance free at the moment is free .
some day as they charge one dollar .
i might be wrong on that it 's no more than one dollar anyway which is nothing , you know ?
it 's % uh not even one u.s. it 's one singapore .
and you see the rest of stops on the kranji express .
% uh they 've got a dairy farm where they have goats producing goats milk .
% uh and % uh , yes .
so if you catch the bus on it 's whole journey , you get to visit the other farms .
but i think sungei buloh itself is enough to interest you .
you need to come here in the morning because they close about six o'clock , seven o'clock .
it will be too late to see anything .
yes .
that is right .
so % um you could time yourself so that when you come out of here , you could go to the bird park so that if no birds waive at you at this park , you go to the bird park and they all be smiling at you .
okay .
let me try and get it for you here .
jurong is the place it is at and it 's also well not too far from here , so it 's convenient to go .
b i r d p a r k , okay .
i 'm getting some noise at your sector .
% ah , okay .
oh it 's ou~ yes , i can hear it .
it sounds like an airplan flying by..
it sounds like an airplan flying by..
okay , so here we have got bird shows , you 'll be very good at taking photographs here .
birds are there .
% uh this aviary , can you see it on your screen ?
yes , the birds are flying free , african -
yes , so-
okay , well test your skill as a photographer .
and we also have a show , % uh two shows in fact .
% uh during showtime they offer you to hold a falcon , and you can photograph your friend and he can photograph you .
and at the sho~
so this is the bird park but , okay , i 'm going to see % uh ticketing , alright ?
because i 'm suggesting that you buy a package ticket so that you can get , okay- so you see it 's open from eighty-thirty 'till six .
and can you see this ?
the one that 's % uh a bit darker in colour .
that is a package .
it 's called a park hopper special .
yah , you see three parks ?
you see the zoo ?
the night safari .
which i suggest on the same day so that you can just walk from the zoo , and the night safari is next door .
and then the bird park you go % uh on the day you go sungei buloh because you can take the train connection from kranji , you would just go southwards and you are at jurong , and you just take a bus and you are there .
the day that you are going to the night safari and zoo , i suggest you eat at the night safari or zoo .
we have some restaurants there .
% uh they have something cute called the bongo burger .
no . the bongo is one of the names of the animals there .
but it 's not .
no , it 's not .
they just used the name of the animal .
% um , at the bird park too , they have a restaurant .
so that would make it much easier .
you would save time .
% uh sing~ do you like hot food ?
do you like curries ?
yah .
% uh the curries that you get in the place where , you know , in little india they are authentic indian taste .
but if you tell them that you do n't want so much chili or , you know , to tell you which one is very hot , then they can tell you and you can avoid ordering those % uh dishes .
% uh but west coast road we have restaurants that serve north and south indian restaurants .
% uh south indian food .
both north and south .
% uh , singaporean food is mostly try at the % uh food courts .
% uh so it is not % uh , what do you call it ?
fine dining .
but it 's where you can actually see everybody cooking and % uh in fact ask the person what is he doing whether they were be very nice to- happy to accomodate you .
and then you can- at the one place you can try chinese , malay and in~ % uh mostly chinese food .
these 's one i am recommending to you .
it 's at old market .
let me get it on the website .
it 's maxwell road food centre .
so it is at place called maxwell road which is in chinatown .
so if you take the train to chinatown from where you are and you'd- it 's near .
you just walk there .
so here you have a picture of the food centre .
can you see the stalls on both sides ?
so all this different coloured signs are different stalls .
and if you like , you- if you go at different times , you get different kinds of food or rather somes stalls if they are shut , they are operating later or earlier .
yes , it 's okay .
here it 's okay .
it 's only at the places of % uh worship that you have to be a bit more careful .
and maybe ask for permission .
but the-
like in a hindu temple or at a bhuddist temple .
% uh you know the people who are praying would not like to photographed .
% uh at the airport % uh discourages % uh photographs .
so you do n't take photographs inside the airport .
outsie the airport if you are taking yourselves standing at the gate , i do n't think anybody will make any noise .
it 's just when you are inside there .
i think all airports are about the same now .
yes , it is .
you must come soon .
yes , i will guide you .
yes , i will guide you .
you come to saint theresa 's church and look for me on the saturday evening mass .
a whole of filipino 's there and you 're right at home .
yes , lots of good food , got lots of accomodation , different prices .
it 's very easy to visit on your own .
you 're most welcome .
so do n't wait too long to come by .
yes , trying to fit in your schedule is not difficult , you know .
you can tell it 's % uh not expensive also .
and for people who read and speak english it 's very easy because english is the working language used .
welcome .
so- bye .
by~ bye elai .
bye .
good afternoon , oh yeah ?
hi .
this- could you just spell it ?
your name for me ?
% hm yes , please .
oh mirelle , huh ?
yes .
yes , mirelle , i 'm jeanne .
j e a n n e. hi mirelle .
hi as well .
alright .
i am fine .
what about you ?
yes .
% uh may i know your age range please ?
% uh is it above thirty or % um .
forties . and your nephew ?
forties . and your nephew ?
oh i 'm glad i asked .
i was still a little boy .
oh that- that 's wonderful .
% uh when are you thinking of coming ?
yes , of course .
i think there are lots of flights .
% uh you can choose anyday actually .
% um what are your interests ?
you want historical places but you also want universal studios , huh ?
i see .
okay .
i 'm going to get into the website of universal studios first .
yes .
let me get into the website .
oh yah .
instant ticket .
no , i think .
alright .
i think about two years or so .
i- not very clear there .
% uh i 'm not one for rides and things like that .
i 've been there .
actually i went there before they opened .
we visited the beautiful hotels there .
i- oh yes .
they are lovely hotels .
they are very luxurious and comfortable- and within walking distance of the % um theatre and- you 're on an island , on sentosa island .
yes , that 's right .
so you could spend your time there - % uh enjoying the sites on the island , besides universal studios .
start % uh-
% uh let me get the package for you , okay ?
yes , thats 's right .
% uh no . but i have a bunch of nephews and nieces that i take out occasionally .
very young ones .
yes , that 's right .
and their children .
no , actually my nephews and nieces are old .
but % uh- it 's their children so i 'm a grandaunt now .
% um , i 'm trying to get the package to appear .
'cause when you buy the package then you will get % uh-
fees .
yah .
that 's right .
okay , let me get your dates .
fifth of april to seventh of april , is that right ?
so it would be one twin room .
are you thinking of staying on the island or % uh-
well , there are many hotels % uh that are very % uh moderately priced .
% uh in the chinatown area .
and near to the island there are other business class hotels like a hundred over dollars .
but if you want to save the money on- to spend time on sho~ % uh spend the money on shopping and other things then we have the three-star hotels .
% uh the space is small within the rooms because most of the them are in conservation shophouses .
ye~ yes . very near .
yes . very near .
% uh convenience stores and shops and food and you can walk around and soak in the atmosphere .
yes .
and they 're also clean and they are , you know ?
it 's just that you do n't have a lot of space in there .
you do n't have the luxury of the five-star .
yes , that 's right .
% uh usually they wi-fi , air-conditioning .
yes .
% uh just wear summer clothes , lights , cottons .
% uh and bring an umbrella in case of rain if you are travelling within sent~
we are warm and also wet .
we get rain intermittently .
off and on .
yes .
so that 's why i-
in april , yes , it may rain .
% uh now if you want to bring a cardigan just for the air-conditioned areas .
% uh the- it 's more the air-conditioning chilling up the place than the real cold .
lots of places for shopping but % uh do you see the screen resorts world singapore ?
or-
yes .
so- so you- your-you see the price there ?
yes .
% uh one % uh- one us dollar - singapore dollar , about one dollar twenty to an american dollar , i think .
i have it- checked .
yes , that 's right .
so you know this is a very high price % uh hotel at five hundred .
it 's top end .
% um- so if you want- yah .
if you want to look at the hotels let me do hotels first then i will come to the other attractions .
and shopping .
okay .
when the- a prince came to singapore long ago , he saw an animal .
and he was told that far away there is an animal called a singa which is lion .
actually- singa .
that 's how- that 's why it 's singapore , you see ?
but actually we do n't have lions naturally found here .
% uh we have tigers or we once had tigers here in the jungle but not lions .
so he could have seen a tiger .
he could have seen a wild boar and he was given the wrong information .
yah , that 's right .
oh , we 've stuck with that name .
% uh maybe it 's confusing for people who know their natural history , right ?
% uh we 're multi-cultural .
% uh different % uh races here .
chinese , being the majority .
and then we have malays and indians .
and we also have % uh eurasians , europeans , % uh large expatriate of communities .
so it 's very easy to visit singapore .
you can get all kinds of food .
% um and we are also very easy to move around i mean accessibility by train , by % uh-
if you compare with europe , it 's much cheaper .
but it 's so much easier and % uh convenient to go by train and by bus .
it 's a-
so % um- yes , that 's right .
% uh okay , wait .
i got the wrong hotels here .
i put chinatown hotels and i got an american chinatown hotel .
let me do it again .
just a minute .
we were % uh- but archaeological diggings have found that chinese have been coming here .
the arabs as well to trade .
so- and that dates back long ago .
but % uh in 1819 , that 's the most recent history a british official in the far east came here and he brought along free trade .
he allowed people of different races to settle here , to trade here .
and he did n't charge taxes and that 's why we became very popular with the people settling here and still today .
okay % um-
yes , it is .
i do n't know the official crime rate but what i know is that you just need to be careful with your belongings and not be a bit careless so that , you know , people do n't just help themselves- your things .
english , it 's more english .
or something that we call singlish which is- a mixture of english with the- chinese grammar .
% uh why you so like that ?
that is-
it 's singlish .
% uh that 's similar why are you behaving this way ?
in a friendly manner , you know ?
so it 's a- you can probably make it out .
% uh it 's fun too .
% um m hotel .
okay , i have got some hotels here for you .
if you 're interested in the island- m hotel is
can you see it on your screen ?
it 's hundred and sixty two dollars .
yes , that 's right .
yah .
it 's and you can take it up from there % uh .
it 's suite side % uh island % uh and take the shuttle bus into % uh sentosa .
so it 's convenient .
% uh let me get the map of singapore for you .
just a minute , i enter-
yah % hm .
can you hear me clearly ?
can you- okay .
let me get the memos .
yes , i can .
you have universal studios , right ?
okay , good .
i 'm gon na get the map for the mass rapid transit .
so that you can relate to where your hotel is .
and where the island that you 'd like to visit , sentosa where it is located .
yes .
yes , mass rapid transit .
i 'll get that on the screen in a moment just let me show you the location first .
okay .
so if you look down , can you see a purple line that goes from % uh the south of the island to the- north ?
can you see ha- you can see harbourfront ?
yes .
so just opposite harbourfront , it's- the island of-
yes .
just opposite it is the island of sentosa .
and m hotel is- do you see tanjong pagar on the green line just nearby ?
that is where the m hotel is .
it will be at sentosa island .
so- shopping % uh-
% uh not so at m hotel because it is nearer the business district .
but if you check into orchard road , that is where the high end shops are .
% uh can you see the red- the-
red line .
do you see it ?
near to number eight .
% uh if you want to go and stay in chinatown we have % uh little boutique hotels in chinatown .
and they 're also the cheaper hotels which are- all the hotels there are usually not so spacious because most of them occupy % uh conservation buildings .
that 's much shophouses .
they join them up like 6 or 8 and they make a hotel .
but they 're very decent inside . they 're
but they 're very decent inside . they 're clean .
yes .
twenty dollars % uh budget- yah .
twenty dollars , probably you 'll get a bed .
i think you 'll get a bed .
% uh % hm % uh you- if you 're interested we get the hostels for you .
let 's see from the website how they are like .
yes , that 's right .
that 's right .
so % uh well this one is good , hangout hotels .
% uh can you see it ?
it 's not really bad .
it 's a- shall i say it 's a good one i think .
it 's a hostel but it 's a good class hostel .
hangout , yes .
just a minute .
we 're trying to get it to come on .
% uh so it 's % uh up-market backpacker .
% uh the location is not bad .
the location is at upper wilkie road which is within walking distance to an mrt station called dhoby ghaut -
where we also have % uh very good % um % uh train connections if you want to go elsewhere .
you can shop at dhoby ghaut which is within walking distance .
by foot , yes . it 's within walking distance and-
by foot , yes . it 's within walking distance and- if you head at that-the other direction you will be in little india which is very full of heritage and culture and history which i believe you mentioned earlier .
yes , food .
food are all over the place .
in singapore , you can get food anywhere anytime .
% uh let me get the room rates for you .
so you have a picture of the room ?
the bed ?
oh dear .
they listed the budget but the room rate is two hundred and eighty five .
yes , net .
% uh but that 's really not a backpacker rate .
yes , that 's right .
% uh let me- okay .
alright , here we go .
okay .
this is another website .
so you can have a private room .
a hundred and twenty
% hm yes .
so i 'm assuming you want a room because if you go dormitory you see what i mean ?
twenty - dollars is at dormitory .
just now i found for other people even cheaper rooms in chinatown but i think this is also fine .
% uh % hm that 's right .
% uh i 'm guessing but i think the room may be a little bit bigger .
okay .
% uh % hm yes .
% uh this hotel the one footprints that we are looking at now it 's in the little india area .
so- yes .
perak road - perak is actually a place in malaysia .
% uh and this area here is right in the heart of little india .
so if you like indian culture % uh this is the place to stay .
but if your preference is for more business class hotel and hotel with
you- if you go there early in the morning , let 's say about nine o'clock or eight thirty . , you can see people marketing .
% uh , shops .
you can see flower garland weavers making fresh flower garlands .
and you can try the indian food .
% uh lots of vegetarian shops there .
% uh well we do n't call it a flea market just individual shops and the prices are very low .
% uh , they are reasonable should i say .
and then you can go into the hindu temples .
they are very colourful .
and- okay .
are you still on the same map ?
can you see the map of footprints ?
can you see serangoon road -
to the left , perak road ?
so these little lanes are very short .
and if you turn to the left there , walk along serangoon road there are about three , four hindu temples .
and if you walk to the back of it , there is a buddhist temple .
% uh two temples , there 's also a church there .
so % uh if you 're into heritage , this is really the place to be in .
it 's full of life , morning , noon and night .
the other place for culture would be chinatown .
% uh bungee jumping i do n't think we have unless it 's purposely organised .
% uh we have- do you know flying fox ?
yes .
we have activities like that .
you know singapore , we want to be a little bit safe .
and bungee jumping , you also need some high cliffs or something , right ?
to-
% uh jump off .
so- yes .
% uh let me try the bungee jump first .
oh we have this % uh reverse bungee jump .
have you heard of it ?
and this is very accessible .
it is % uh right along the singapore river .
so if you open your eye to get a lot to see while you are upside down .
% uh it is % uh set up right next to our singapore river and % uh- i 'm trying to get it .
can you see the little picture on the right ?
that same space .
okay , i 'll be honest with you , i 'm a coward , i have n't been up on this .
yes .
i- yes .
and it 's very accessible .
yes % uh and you can- you can also ride with him .
yah .
% uh a lot of tourists come here .
% uh the zip-line , i think you have to- what is it you call it ?
can you give it to me again ?
% uh usually it's- yah , usually it 's organised for groups like , you know , college students .
zip-line .
yah .
we used to have it on sentosa and % uh i do n't know if they still have it now .
where you zip from one end to the other end , right ?
well we have it a little bit out of town .
% uh okay , zip-line adventure park .
oh we have on sentosa , right at the bottom , but let me get to this one first .
this is a megazip adventure park .
yes , it 's on sentosa .
you are brave if you dare to try zip-line .
i did paragliding in % uh thailand and % uh my nieces thought i- i-
oh i enjoyed it , yes .
i enjoyed it very much % uh except that , you know , the insurance does n't cover that .
yah , so you really have to be an adventurist to do it .
zip-line is better , i think .
it 's safer .
% uh bungee jump - % uh it 's the top of the hill , i think .
let me see , huh .
to the beach if i 'm not mistaken .
yes , let me see it .
all these especially at % uh the big organisers like this , they are very safe .
do n't have to worry .
even the- % uh the youngsters , they do this zip-line .
and they also go on their- what do you call it ?
roller blades and skateboards .
% uh it 's a bit scary for people like me .
% uh oh there 's another one , that 's a new one on sentosa .
% uh i forget the name .
you 'll get into a % um oh dear what is it called ?
let me try .
you get into % uh a small building and you have these people help you float in the air .
because the wind is blowing at you at high speed .
% uh you-
you put on a- % uh no , you put on a suit .
you put on a protective suit and you wear tennis shoes .
i 've done it so it ca n't be that scary .
yes .
we all survived it so do n't worry .
so even here , can you see the harness is- fully fitted .
% uh that 's what-
let me see if they have price .
no . % um i was at the place where i could have tried it but % uh i chickened out in the end .
because it 's too high speed for me .
yes , i sound young .
it 's a ploy .
i-
the zip-line prices are not on .
i think % uh it could be- let me see .
zip-line sentosa should have it .
no , they are showing-
yah , something like that .
% um sometimes they organise it for a group and then they have special prices .
it 's built-in with other adventures .
oh you can go into the casinos free of charge because you 're a tourist .
sentosa .
yes , sentosa has one .
there 's another one at marina bay sands .
both of them are casinos .
yes .
i think-
so i think it 's from the top of the hill to one of the little islands there which is built off-just off the beach .
so you 're getting a view of the beach at sentosa .
yes .
% uh what you are hearing is the sound of the wind .
if you look at the video , i think that 's the sound of the wind .
% uh just now when you saw the video with all the noise .
that was the sound of the wind- because they are travelling at high speed .
% uh now we are putting up for you .
okay .
we have another zip-line at bedok reservoir road .
are you getting it on your screen here ?
no , me~ megazip is what you just saw .
forest zip- yes , forest adventure .
and- okay .
okay , i 'm getting them on the line % uh to see if i can get any prices here .
okay , booking .
yes .
because i think they need a minimum % uh okay .
so we have their numbers there .
alright .
yes .
that 's right .
% hm yes .
because they do n't do it for you just for one person .
they need to have a number of people .
so you see here- do you see here now ?
places available .
and your weight , you can not be- too heavy .
the line will not hold .
alright .
yah , that is % uh-
i do n't know .
what- so you like % um % uh you know like universal studio , right ?
let me get your- first-
that 's right .
% um , if you are very keen on culture then little india stay would be good , otherwise- % uh your % uh m hotel would be good .
and then- you see it took- so-
i would- say five days .
have five or six days .
i 'm a relaxed traveller . i
i 'm a relaxed traveller . i like to do things slowly .
so- yah .
yah .
yes , too stressful .
yes .
% uh then you can go to other attractions , you see ?
% uh you may have to downgrade your hotel .
% uh since you are able to travel by the mass rapid transit , the train system let me get you on the mrt map .
you can find that you can get anywhere on it .
yes .
yes , then- if you spend your time-because when you shop you spend a lot of time .
instead of that , you can move to places .
% uh yes .
yes .
that 's right .
then you can travel .
do you see the map on your screen ?
yes .
% uh try all the different kinds of food and % uh if you are used to eating % um you know , adventurous in food , you do n't need to sit down at the restaurant .
then again not only do you save money .
but % uh you get % uh authentic local food and you can intermingle with the locals at the food centres .
i like a very old one .
but first let me finish the map here , okay ?
% uh can you see changi airport ?
so if you take down the train down the green line .
you just take it to tanah merah , can you see it ?
just two stops away .
look at number three on your right .
can you see number three on your right ?
that 's where changi .
airport is .
you would land at changi airport .
so you just take a short shuttle to tanah merah and you take the westbound .
and you would be in town .
so depending on where you stay .
% uh if you choose to stay in little india , you will switch at city hall to dhoby ghaut .
can you see the red line ?
at % uh number eight .
number eight is a major interchange station .
and if you move up to the little india stop , there you are .
in little india-in between little india and farrer park , there are small % uh hotels there .
and i think we saw one of them just now , right ?
if you move the other way down to chinatown , there are also many little hotels .
and these hotels are converted shophouses .
so it 's % uh bit of heritage that you 're living in .
so-
visit , yes , then you walk around .
so if you 're in little india , you visit the little india area on foot .
say in the morning .
and then you can move by train to chinatown and visit chinatown on foot .
yes .
orchard then you go connect the- on the-
you go back to dhoby ghaut , which is the major interchange and full of shops there .
you at-
and eating places .
you move north to orchard .
so in little india , you try the indian food .
yah .
you 're going to say-
yes , curry , you can get- you take note of the name , race course road .
let me see if i can get it for you .
there are lot of restaurants there .
and along serangoon road which is the main road % uh in little india you have many vegetarian restaurants also .
in fact it 's a great place % uh for vegetarians in little india because many of the hindus here are vegetarian .
oh yes .
% uh once you pay for a cup of coffee you can get a whole % uh vegetarian meal - in little india .
or chinese noodles in chinatown , you know like- three , four dollars .
yes .
you might need another % uh a second portion if you have a healthy appetite .
% uh but otherwise , you know % uh it 's % uh more than enough .
for me it 's more than enough .
and we have this website called hungrygowhere .
and muthu curries is one of % uh my favourite places .
it 's on race course .
the area used to be a race course in the days of the british .
when-
yes .
that's- you can take chili , right ?
you can take chilli ?
% uh , okay .
you can tell them and maybe they can % uh modify you- modify a bit for you because we have many expatriates here but some of them like it really hot .
the british expatriates % uh love it hot .
% uh mirelle .
yes .
but you have to do the approaching .
normally we mind our own business .
so if you 're lost , we expect you to ask us and then we will be very helpful .
but they will maybe not come out and approach you .
although we 're trying to change that mindset right now .
yes .
yes .
they would be very helpful and if you get in to any train station % uh the officers there would be very happy to direct you .
i was supposed to show you the- i want to just show you this about the % uh okay .
train , you see the train map here ?
are you getting the maps or- ez-link card .
this is a card we carry and i suggest you get it when you come .
that 's right , you do n't have to worry about it .
and the best place to get it is at the airport .
because % uh what- you- okay .
what is this ?
why am i getting this- pictures ?
you see .
i think they tied up with a lot of people .
% uh with the ez-link card , you can buy food as well .
so if you put in a lot of money- you have to put in money first when you buy the card .
and then when you buy the card , you % um get benefits at certain places .
okay .
seve~ even sell them at seven eleven stores .
like as i said , if you get it at the airport % uh i think they can supply you with a little map to go with it .
let 's see .
okay .
can you see at the bottom of the screen ?
% uh , twelve dollars , yes .
and % uh- yes , that 's right .
% uh when you buy it at seven eleven stores , they only charge you ten .
when you buy it at the post office outlets , it 's five dollars .
but- no , it 's the top-up value .
% um you need to put in money on top of this value .
you see ?
that 's right .
yes , that 's right .
so you put in money .
so if you think you 're gon na travel a lot , you can put in more money .
and when you leave at the airport , leave some time to go back to the office and get your refund .
yes .
yes .
that 's right , yes .
so- % uh normally at the singpost and seven eleven , they think people are just using it as a convenience .
so it 's a bit cheaper , yah , but you can get your balance value so it 's not a problem .
serangoon road is little india .
% uh maybe when you do little india you do chinatown as well .
because they 're both of the same line .
yes .
two stops on the line .
and then when you go to % uh universal studios and the forest adventure you do it on another day .
so % uh that 's what your two days will allow you to do .
if you want more % uh you need to stay about 5 days i think .
then you need to visit- you can visit attractions like the zoo , the night safari , the bird park .
and nature reserves .
okay ?
oh % ah . % uh the zoo , the bird park and the night safari are places that tourists normally go to .
and other attractions on sentosa island .
like that so .
yes .
at least five days i think .
yes .
and you can spend one day shopping also .
okay .
that 's okay alright .
and i look seeing you mirelle .
alright .
so do come mirelle .
i 'm holding a senior citizens travel pass that 's how-
yes .
we only get that when we are- i think sixty two or something like that .
yes , i 'm serious , but i love young people and i 'm interacting with them all the time .
so-
thank you very much mirelle , you made my day .
so do come , okay ?
and really ma~ really five days is what you need .
yes .
yes .
yah .
i enjoyed it as well .
yes , i do hope to see you mirelle .
meet you on the street one day , huh ?
alright , mirelle .
goodbye .
alright .
yes .
thank you .
alright .
bye .
yes .
hi , good afternoon .
this- % uh this is % uh tour guide number one , and my name is lynnette .
and how may i address you ?
okay , and would i be able to get your name ?
hi jo .
yes , that 's right .
hi .
okay jo , may- how may i help you ?
two days in singapore , % uh ?
okay .
now , in august actually the first week of august , singapore is going to celebrate our birthday .
but that would be mid-august for you ?
okay .
and- friday to sunday , okay .
and % uh what are your what would you- what are you thinking of doing here ?
okay , we do have nice beaches on sentosa island .
so you could do your swimming and other activities on sentosa island .
% uh we do have also a beach on the mainland singapore % uh but it 's just a simple beach .
okay , the mainland of singapore , we have our beach over at the east coast .
% uh yes , we have pretty deep sea water around the coastline of singapore .
so i would say that is not very calm sea .
okay , so i would think % uh sentosa beaches would be more to your liking because you have a beautiful beach out there , in fact there are a few .
% uh and also % uh very calm because the waters there are pretty calm .
because you can actually swim inside the lagoon .
so i 'm going to show you % uh the sentosa .
alright , i 'm gon na just show you sentosa and i 'm just going to show you some of the beaches we have .
okay , this is one of them it 's called siloso beach .
and the other beaches would be pahlawan .
okay , that 's pahlawan coming up .
okay , you can see they are beautiful , right ?
okay , and the other one will be tanjong beach .
okay , so they are all very nice beaches on % uh sentosa island .
okay , this is the one the sentosa beach % uh i 'm talking about , okay ?
so nice % uh clean and calm waters , i think that would suit what you are looking for .
% uh we have summer the whole year around .
so there is no % uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december , % uh in terms of our weather .
just in december the weather gets one degree cooler , that 's all .
yes .
% uh no we- fortunately here we do n't have % uh the natural disaster , because we , yah .
we do n't have % uh earthquakes , we do n't have tornados .
% uh what we have here would be just very mild monsoon rain .
or i would say very heavy rains , that 's about it .
% um okay it 's generally happening in % uh the month of november .
% uh you can still come because % uh although you may have heavy rains , the rains do % uh stop , alright , after a short while .
% uh so we do have people coming to singapore from january to december .
% uh i think we are very different .
our beaches are i would say man-made , alright .
and % uh they are very safe to swim because % uh you have % uh what we call lagoons .
yes , so it 's safe to swim in the lagoons and also in the lagoons itself , you have these buoys .
so as long as you 're just swimming inside the buoys , you are actually i would say very safe .
so if you are looking at the safe place % uh to swim and very convenient to the hotels .
% uh that would something that i would recommend .
% uh no , we- i would not recommend you to go snorkelling in sentosa .
% uh we normally do i would say scuba diving off % uh the southern islands of singapore .
yah .
yes , it 's an island of the southern part of singapore .
% uh no , yah .
we normally would not % uh do snorkelling % uh on sentosa island .
% uh like i said no , unfortunately .
but % uh we do more of % uh scuba diving of the off-shores islands of singapore .
okay , would i be able to introduce you to a beach volleyball on the beach ?
okay on sentosa -
yes .
yes .
so on the sentosa there are so many attractions , alright .
% uh will you be coming with % uh small children or just for adults ?
okay , well % uh i think that the your child would be interested in this % uh attraction called the butterfly park and insect kingdom .
% uh and in this small little park , you get to see all this insects .
and part of inside the park itself , you will also be walking through an % uh open-air , as you can see , you see the butterflies are just parked .
or % uh they just % uh hang on to the person itself , alright .
okay , so yah and as you can see the scorpion as well .
okay , so these are- this is a small % uh but very compact butterfly kingdom , % uh butterfly park and insect kingdom .
and i think if your son is % uh very much into a little bit more adventurous and a little bit more exciting or in fact your whole family , yourself and your wife included , you could go and do this mega-zip adventure park .
it 's like an obstacle kind of a park , if you can see .
so this is also found on the island itself .
so you do n't have to travel , you know , to many areas .
% uh you can do a lot of things just on the island itself , alright ?
so this is one of them and another attraction you would also be interested in this , it 's called the skyline luge .
okay , this is like % uh a bit like bumper cars .
yah , but you are going downslope .
okay , you are going downslope , so it 's really exciting % uh if you get on to this luge , and you can do a one-way luge and the other way by % uh skyline is the open-air cable car .
kind of a thing , yah .
so these are the some of the games or sport you can do on % uh sentosa itself .
% uh the whole island is resort .
okay , the whole island of sentosa .
so we have different sections , % uh i 've given you some of the attraction that is found on the island where you can do .
alright ?
% uh of course there are lot more .
% uh you can even climb up or take a ride into the merlion .
okay , this merlion is a symbol of singapore .
% uh half lion and half fish tail , okay ?
and , yes , so you can actually do % uh a sort of % uh go inside the lion and take the lift right up to the mouth of lion and have good eye view of % uh sentosa and even towards indonesia .
yes .
yes .
okay , the admission into this merlion park is eight dollars for an adult , and five dollars for child .
so if your child is ten , yes that would be child rate .
yes , everything will be in singapore dollars .
% uh one us dollars will give you approximately about a one dollar and twenty seven cents singapore money .
okay , so this one us dollar will give you approximately about a dollar twenty seven % uh singapore % uh money , alright ?
so if you want to make things easier , then it 's about a dollar thirty cents .
yah but it 's actually less , yah .
it 's about a one point two seven at today 's rate .
okay , so % uh there are other attractions but i will % uh , you know , skip that .
as you can see , right , there are a lot more attraction on % uh sentosa itself .
and of course in the night time , you may want to do a show on sentosa .
okay , we have % uh the song of the sea that comes on every night .
yah , it 's call- is a show , it 's a water laser and fire show .
that comes on in the night time .
the first show is at seven forty and it last about twenty minutes .
yah .
so that is the show that you may want to do .
and of course we have a theme park called universal studio on sentosa island .
yes .
yes .
% uh no , it 's on the % uh sentosa island .
yes , correct .
not on the mainland , yah .
so there are- so these are just some of the scenes % uh it 's divided into seven zone .
okay , so these are just some of the scene .
this is one of the rides .
okay , and of course you can take photographs with the characters .
well we have % uh madagascar .
okay , hollywood area .
% oh we do n't really have like a peak season .
% uh maybe you get a little bit more crowd in june and december because that is also our school holidays here in singapore .
% uh and of course some of the public holidays , % um then you get % uh more local people .
otherwise % uh i think it would be fairly % uh , it is not like really crowded if you are going into % uh the theme park .
yes .
% uh yah we do n't have major holidays except on the ninth of august , that 's our birthday in august .
% uh ninth , on the ninth of august .
yes .
yes , and we do have a big birthday parade % um % uh in singapore in the month of august , % uh ninth of august .
otherwise % uh the rest of august we do n't have other major festival .
% uh yes , % uh of course weekday , then you do n't have to % um have a queue % uh in the- of course the more popular rides like the transformer rides .
so weekday i would say % uh yes , we get lesser crowd .
but even on weekend it is not like % uh really so crowded as you have to squeeze-in your way , % uh no , yah .
% uh universal studio ?
disneyland .
yah , that i would say may be saturday , sunday , yes you do have to queue a bit of time .
% uh maybe the more popular rides would be like transformer , yes maybe you do have to queue like fifty minutes over the weekends .
% uh but otherwise , i think it 's manageable .
yes , that 's right .
yes , correct .
and do you want me to recommend your hotel to stay in sentosa island ?
yes .
yes .
% uh there are some hotels % uh just within the universal studio area .
there are some % uh hotels out there , okay .
so you can choose to stay % uh there as well .
alright , they are all relatively new hotels .
% uh no we do n't have a four-star hotel % um , the resort world hotel would be , i would say they are different category of hotel because they are % uh resorts hotels , right .
% um and
okay , there is one more hotel .
remember earlier on i showed you the beach ?
% uh okay there is % uh resort % uh hotel called the rasa sentosa .
yah , and it is actually the same chain as the % uh shangri-la hotel .
yah , but it 's a different kind of category of hotel .
this is resort .
okay , so this one i can recommend you % um this would be % uh the hotel out on % uh the island .
so maybe you can stay % uh one night out there .
% uh it 's a beachfront hotel .
the rooms ?
% oh the location ?
okay the location .
okay , just- if you- now you are looking at the % uh this is the back of the re~ % uh sentosa resort .
% uh in the front area you- it overlooks the siloso beach .
yah , remember just now i showed you the siloso beach ?
yes , so it actually overlooks the beach .
and it 's quite a pretty % uh hotel .
yes , it 's just next to the beach .
yah , right on the beach , yes .
so it 's a beachfront hotel .
okay , so this is % uh rasa sentosa hotel .
% eh i- okay , i will show you the rates .
yah let 's see whether they have % uh , okay .
so you planning to tour august seventeen to august % uh eighteen .
alright , let see whether-
okay there will be two adults and one child .
okay , so it will show the rates .
okay .
% oh yes , it 's available % um-
yah the rates % uh would be singapor dollars % uh four hundred and ten dollars per night .
yah and it right on the beach , okay .
so you could stay one night on the resort and the next day you can go over to the mainland .
% oh okay , no it-
alright .
okay , what do your wife , yourself and your child like to see ?
alright .
okay , we had lots of shopping options in singapore .
% um even the locals like to shop and eat , alright .
so % hm a lot of us goes to this road called orchard road to do our shopping .
and , yes .
and you can- you are actually looking at one of our % uh newer shopping centre called ion on orchard road .
if you look at the map below , you see the pink highlighted area ?
that is orchard road .
it 's one straight road .
alright and , yes again you see some of the % uh street seen in orchard road , alright ?
full of greenery mature trees and every other building would be % uh a shopping centre , a hotel , dining area on orchard road itself .
okay ?
yes , and what would- what does she likes to shop for ?
what do you think she will like to shop for ?
% uh we do n't really call our shops market here .
% uh but just on the junction of this building % uh ion , % uh beside the main road is orchard road , the other road is scotts road .
so if you just walk down , % uh you will come to this shopping mall called the % um % uh far east shopping centre .
okay , now this sell % uh the i would say the budget and mid-range kind of products % uh that ranges from hair accessories , % uh ear accessories , right up to fashion and shoes .
so that is one option that you may wan na consider .
all these shops are just one shop , so they do n't really have chain shops .
% uh so it 's not like the high fashion .
% uh the other place that i would like to recommend % uh for the cheaper options of shopping would be bugis , alright .
% uh so this is an area , another area again it 's the shopping mall .
% uh i mean next to the bugis mrt train station , if you look on your right-hand side .
% uh you can , yah .
yah , you can see bugis junction .
okay , so there is a red building just a five minutes from the mrt , % uh and again there are all tiny shops .
% uh so if you want to talk about market then , maybe that would be quite similar to what you are talking about .
% uh so there are no branded items there , basically they are just % uh fashionable wear .
so this is the other shopping option .
% uh would you and your son like to look at any of our war museum federal ?
okay .
so i would be able to recommend he- % uh you a science centre which a lot of school children , they like to go to this % uh place call the science centre .
okay , so this is % uh a visit to the science centre and it 's quite interactive as well .
% uh again it 's very accessible .
you can take the subway again , the mrt , and goes towards the western part of singapore .
so this is the science centre , and your son will , well , enjoy like a few hours % uh in this science centre itself , alright .
so i 'm going to show you like what are the exhibitions .
okay in here there are all very interactive .
okay , inside here .
okay so some of these are permanent exhibitions and they are always there all the time .
but of course at certain time of the year , they have different focus .
so it 's really very interactive , very % um stimulating actually for children as well as for adult .
yes .
okay , i 'm giving you the rates .
okay , let me just-
yes , % uh it is very simple to take the % uh mrt .
yes , there are % uh signs are all written in english .
so it 's actually very easy to get by .
% uh we have just % uh a few line , alright , at the east-west line and of course the reverse direction , that is the green colour line .
and north-south line will be in red colour .
% uh and % uh north-east line % uh that would be a purple colour .
and a second line that is in yellow .
yes .
so % uh and of course it always go in reverse direction , yah .
so very easy to take the % uh subway , our mrt .
yah , so-
yes .
okay , our mrt is charge as well based on % uh distance travel .
alright ?
so let 's say if you 're in the east , you want to travel down to let say orchard road , that would be a cost of % uh approximately about two dollars .
two dollars and twenty cents singapore dollars .
% uh , yah so you- since you 're only going to spend like two days , i would just recommend you to buy % uh like the standard ticket .
% uh no . you just buy like a per trip basis .
% uh we have like % uh not the one day pass , % uh but we have like a tourist pass .
so because i do n't think you 're going to travel that much , so i think it is cheaper if you just buy % uh per trip basis .
yes .
okay , so , yah ea~ your earlier question like how much does it cost in science , nine dollars % uh for- yes , nine dollars the admission .
% uh for child up to sixteen years , that would be five dollars .
yes .
yah .
yah .
yah and of course we do have like a four d kind of a show .
% uh again it depends on what show it 's gon na show in august .
% uh that 's like in a three hundred sixty degrees kind of facility theatre .
% uh no , that 's an additional of ten dollars .
yah .
yes .
but there is option , huh , whether you want to see this show or not .
otherwise % uh-
yah .
yes , correct .
% uh no , normally our hotels would include the breakfast .
yes .
yes .
correct .
so like for if you 're spending the whole day on sentosa island , % uh or in universal studio , there are meals , there are dining options available out there .
okay , so you could have like a just simple meal % um like a sandwich or something in the park .
and for dinner options , % uh because % uh you 'll be spending % uh quite a fair amount on your hotel stay .
so maybe i can recommend you % uh to do like our street food .
% uh yes we do have a food court % uh located on sentosa island .
% uh for a meal with drink , let 's say a main course with a drink that would cost you approximately about ten dollars .
per person .
yah ten singapore dollars per person .
yes , so you can have like % uh fried hokkien noodles , % uh a fried carrot cake , alright , satay .
yes .
yes , fried carrot cake .
% ah okay , yah .
our fried be~ % uh carrot cake version is very different from % uh the american fried % uh carrot cake or the european versions .
% uh this is a savoury % uh kind of egg with white radish .
yes , it 's actually white radish that has been grated % uh and with rice flour .
so it 's cooked like a little bit- some of them cook it like pancake style .
so it 's the savoury and we can eat it for breakfast , lunch or dinner .
yah , it 's actually quite filling , yah .
so that is something that is % uh i think not found in your country .
so you may want to try that .
yah .
challenging , okay , eating with your hands would be like either the chili crabs or % uh pepper crabs , this will be challenging .
or if you really want something very exotic , % uh we do take % uh the turtle soup in singapore .
yes .
but again not many % um % uh not many % uh food court will offer this option .
so you would be able to find them in chinatown for this particular dish .
if you are talking about very exotic food .
% uh we do have- from the street food i think it will be like satay at % uh at the satay club over at old % uh lau pa sat .
okay , and that is- okay , what is satay ?
satay is marinated meat % uh cooked- % uh pierced with skewers and it 's cooked over charcoal .
okay , so that is satay .
okay , the fast food that is available here would ranges from mcdonalds , % uh mcdonalds right up to wendy 's , kfc .
okay , so , yah .
this would be some of the % uh fast food that we have here .
yes .
% uh yes .
yah .
because if you are going to stay in a % uh i would say % uh % um % uh above- let say about three to four hundred dollars stay in the res~ % uh in the hotel , then you could actually % um of course take a chance to % uh taste all our local food , our street food in full .
okay , so % uh besides-
yah , this is what i 'm going to show you is claypot rice .
yah , okay .
it 's a rice cooked in a claypot , so you get this aroma and of course % uh most of the time % uh they have either- you can ask for seafood or chinese sausage or chicken % uh % um in this dish , alright ?
it 's like one pot meal .
yah , so this is another food that you may want to try .
yah meat and % uh a bit of % uh vegetables .
% uh yes % uh in the non-air-conditioned food centre .
yah .
% uh average temperature in the afternoon % uh ranges from about thirty degrees to thirty two degrees % uh any time of the year .
% uh in the mor~ in the evening from let say eight o'clock onwards , % uh the temperature will go down to twenty six degrees right up to the morning % uh about seven o'clock in the morning .
yah , so we do n't have drastic change of temperature .
yes .
% ah okay .
this bugis remember earlier on i also introduce to % uh like a no brand kind of a shopping ?
alright , so in all our shopping centre , there 's always % uh air-conditioned food court .
% uh but the bugis one it 's open air , so you can- of course try this food , it is sold in either % uh air-condition food centre or non-air-conditioned food centre .
the non-air-condition % uh food centre would be , the prices would be a little bit cheaper .
so let say you could get it for four dollars and if you 're going to have % uh your- the same kind of food in air-condition % uh food centre , then you pay about six dollars .
right .
% oh n~ yes , our water here is very clean .
so if you do n't really have % uh very weak stomach , we can actually drink directly from the tap .
% uh but of course again , you are not so sure whether your stomach can take it or not .
then of course i still recommend you to take the boiled water or yes or bottled water .
but otherwise our tap water is very clean % uh in singapore .
yes .
yah , so % eh once you turn on the tap , you get clean water .
yes .
yes , you get clean water throughout % uh all the areas in singapore .
yah .
pleasure .
yes , we hope to see you soon then .
okay , welcome .
okay , bye .
hello .
hello .
this is je~ good afternoon .

you can get a twin room , right ?
twi~ twin is separate beds and % uh- % uh twin and double is the same .
is just that whether you have- you want to squeeze-in one big bed or you want to have your own tiny bed .
but not really tiny , but what i mean is single bed .
some people do n't like to sleep with other people because they toss and turn and bash them up in their sleep .
yah .
okay .
ok~ oh yes .
if you are staying just one night , you have a good choices % uh for % uh that one night .
so- three-star you say ?
then you have a lot of money left over for only a thousand dollars .

the hotels would all have air conditioning in singapore .
and % uh what you want is attached bathroom and you want a fridge .
% uh we also have % uh okay , we have a list here .
alright .
a good view ?
okay .
i 've got you this hotel .
it 's called gallery hotel .
are you getting it on your screen ?
can you see the picture at the top ?
% uh that 's the view .
you 're looking at singapore river .
and that 's part of the theatres on the bay .
% uh you ca n't quite see here .
but on the right side of that picture % uh some of the tall buildings in the business district .
so it 's really a nice view .
and your hotel , look at it on your right .
oh yes .
can you see ?
it is a sort of art piece with the different colours .
ex~ exactly .

let 's see the facilities that they have .
you 've got internet interactive .
% uh connectivity .
yes .
you have tv with remote cable .
tea and coffee making facility , hair dryer .
bathroom amenities .

yes , safe .
very safe .
you have the swimming pool .
i think this is the dining area , the middle picture .
so it 's very good class .
i do n't know why they call themselves three-star .
the lobby is here .
it 's not big in size .
but it 's in a good location .
yes and it~ let me see % uh-

that is also within walking % uh distance from your hotel .
% uh you walk along the river and % uh you will reach it in no time .
and behind is a first class hotel , the fullerton hotel .
and there 's also a museum nearby .
so i 'm waiting for the rates to appear right now .
yes , that is right .
because in case you come by yourself , you know , % um these places are within walking distance .

that 's okay , right ?
okay .
now , you were asking me about- % uh what was your next question ?
okay .
let me get to the mass rapid transit .
is it- without much hassle i would say take-
you take the train which is the fastest .
any traffic jams , % uh it 's not affected by it .
no , you would n't get lost because the signage is very good .
and at the station when you arrive at the airport , you will get a help from the station master or the officer % uh at the station .
so-
so let me show you where you are .
this is the map of the southern part of singapore .
and if you- are you getting the map ?
can you see on the right-hand side number three in green ?
number three .
that is where the airport is .
so if you go down to the basement when you arrive and buy a transit ticket , i 'll tell you more about it later .
% uh first you change some money and then you buy your transit ticket with a card .
and % uh you can use the card , you top it up with money and use the card .
before you go back you provide time to get a refund on the unused portion .
they just hold back a little bit for the manufacture of the card .
that is all .
okay , you travel along the green line .
and you come to the- let me see .
you go down to outram park .
can you see the purple line ?
where the green hits the purple right at the bottom .
so you switch to the north line and you are at chinatown .
and-
if you go to the next stop clarke quay , that 's very near to your hotel .
and if you , yes .
clarke quay is where you get off and you have to- you may have to walk across the river .
they do n't show the
the bridges across the river .
but it 's very nice .
it 's very pleasant walk .
i 've done it just for fun myself .
yes that's- yes .
so and- yes , there 's a train station there in the basement .
and you can see it branching off , right ?
there 's number one there .
so what they have done is they have split it so that you have to take it only to tanah merah and then you take the westbound line .
you make sure you switch on the westbound or else you 'll end up in another part of town called pasir ris .
which is also fun .
is a holiday area , it 's near the sea .
oh % um . yes that would be okay .
% uh but the signs are very clear .
and if you ask anybody there , most of them are working at the airport .
they will direct you to the right direction .
okay .
the simple food is it ?
% uh you do n't want to try like at the market or % um you do n't want to- so is your stomach delicate or-
oh you are lucky .
shrimps and crabs are quite expensive .
crabs especially .
they are not so cheap in singapore % uh because singaporeans love it .
so if you go the food courts in the singapore , you- the good thing is you can actually see what you are eating .
yah , because they cook right in front of you .
okay .
% uh then i suggest you eat near your hotel , since you do n't have much time .
% uh i believe that for lunch they were having a fifteen dollar promotion .
i have noticed that all the restaurants were having that promotion , so you could have your choice of italian , western , asian , % uh that 's for lunch .
dinner it 's a different story , because that is a nice place to be at .
so the dinner prices go up quite a bit .
and-
yah .
% uh no , usually it 's a set meal .
and they stipulate what you are eating .
so % um you are sort of told exactly what you are going to eat , exist .
something that you might want to try in singapore .
we 've got these restaurants here .
% uh but they are % uh not in your location .
but i 'm trying to look for a dish .
okay .
okay .
okay , this place is good .
it's- let me try and get it for you .
it 's called crystal jade and it 's at holland .
% uh holland % uh is not name after the country , it 's named after an architect .
% uh you can take the train and % uh you will % uh end-up at holland just nearby and you can just walk here .
and this place is called crystal jade .
they have a chain of restaurants all over .
but holland has got % uh nice ambiance also so you might want to walk around there .
yes , it 's nice , it 's simple but it 's nice .
it 's not posh , so it wo n't break your bank .
but it serves % uh better than average chinese food i think .
% uh do you know this dish xiao long bao ?
it is a little dumpling .
yah steamed and it 's actually got a bit of soup inside the dumpling which is unusual .
so you see the prices here ?
spending twenty one dollars to thirty dollars .
okay , a cheap meal at the food centre % uh simple noodles would be only three dollars .
so if you have two plates , six dollars .
so this is more expensive than that .
and more than the fifteen dollar set meal that you get down by the river where you are .
yah .
if you want indian food ?
do you want indi~
wait , let me get you-
yes , % uh-
there 's a place- there 's a place called race course road in singapore .
located where there used to be a real race course in the early days .
and there are full of indian restaurants there .
okay i 'm just gon na go-
indian restaurants .
race course road restaurants in singapore .
okay .
so here we have a list of them .
% uh on the northeast line , % uh there 's a stop right at little india .
so , when you get off the train station , you just walk .
and~ yes , that is right .
and these are the major restaurants there .
banana leaf , i go there myself .
% um banana leaf means you actually eat off a clean banana leaf .
% uh is- the food is good .
it 's also hot , if you like hot food .
but you see here they have north indian and they have south indian .
so if you do n't go for too much hot food , you can go for the north indian .
yes .
south indian food cuisine is quite hot .
chili hot .
and the north indian is milder .
is got spices but it is not so burning on the tongue .
and we have something called fish head curry .
have you- heard of it ?
they got- they get the head of a big fish and they cook curry with % uh tomato and lady 's fingers and a little bit of tamarind , so it 's slightly sourish .
and it 's the favourite of the locals here .
chewy , what do you call it ?
ch~ chewy junior , let me see .
oh !
% uh no but we have similar things .
there , do you see junior- but i got it here junior singapore .
yes , chewy junior singapore .
now i 'm learning something from you .
it 's at bugis junction .
it 's also on the train .
yah the bugis is % uh one of the stops of on the east-west line .
say vanilla cream , cream puffs , doughnuts .
yes , and it's- so you could also shop there if you want that whole area-
yes , and % uh-
% uh there is a lane there that you can shop .
it 's in this bugis area right across the road .
you can see there 's a small lane and they have lots of little stalls on either side .
so if you are looking-
% uh if you could- yah i guess you could call it a flea market .
a bit more organised than a flea market .
and- the train station is called bugis .
bugis is the name of the % uh one of the peoples from indonesia that came over and settle there % uh two hundred years ago .
yes , but they are no longer , you know ?
they 've inherit- they 've inter-married with the local malays and they have- the people have- the malays have merely moved out to the eastern side .
so this is like a major shopping area , there are offices there as well .
yes , you can buy lots of things .
at bugis there is a big shopping centre % uh it 's called bhg .
it stands for be here for good .
because they took over the store from another store that closed .
so i 'm not joking .
it 's true .
yah .
but the~ nobody knows- i mean not- very few people bother what is about .
so you got ta look for bhg and it 's at the bugis station .
and like i said across the road where that little alley is , the bugis lane you can look for lots of funky clothes , you might like them .
% uh t-shirts and things , shoes .
yes , you can buy a lot of things there .
there you-
you can get them there .
and also walk to chinatown from your hotel .
and when you 're at little india , if you go a little bit earlier , for your dinner , you go across the road to little india arcade and you can get lots of souvenirs there too .
okay i 'm put up- find you some % uh i- what are you interested in ?
what exactly-
you 're talking about a live show ?
performances ?
okay .
i think i forgot .
well , if you are open-dated about your arrival % uh i would recommend that you go- i put the wrong the spelling .
just a minute .
we have a lovely theatre by the river and it 's also within walking distance of your hotel .
it 's called the theatres on the bay .
there are two major theatres and smaller studios .
% uh wait .
let me get it , the ticketing .
so there are concerts and there are also % uh shows % um sort of- during the different periods of time like during chinese new year , we have more chinese themed concerts .
during the indian festival time they have indian musicians coming and indian concerts .
% uh let me see .
so you 're talking about show , i 'll go to the theatres on the bay and see if i can- a calendar .
% uh magic shows -
oh .
okay .
% ah okay .
ther~ okay , just give me a moment to get back there .
i 'm trying to get to their programme section .
% uh it depends on the type of show .
if it 's an international artist you are watching , then it 's expensive .
but if it 's % uh something not so- somebody not so well-known or high profile then it 's a little bit better .
just let me-
because you are staying one day and it is a bit limited .
yah , you know .
i think five days is good .
yes , then you go- % uh we have good shows at marina bay sands that 's where one of the casinos is .
% uh but-
you know the casino theatre ?
yes .
okay .
% uh you do n't have to gamble there if you are just seeing the show .
if you like heritage then little india and % uh chinatown % uh to walk around it 's very exciting .
and then to try some of the local food .
and then in evening you might want to % uh go and see the shows what the one show .
by the river just outside your hotel .
yes and walk down the river towards the bay where the merlion is .
yah the merlion .
have you heard of the merlion ?
it 's a- it is a symbol for the singapore tourism board originally % uh because a prince that came to singapore thought he saw an animal and he was wondering what it was .
and someone told him it 's a lion .
but we have no lions in singapore .
no records of lions .
so we think he saw perhaps a tiger or a big deer and because we are a % uh , you know , we are an island and we were a fishing village and now we are an international sea port , so we have the mer for mermaid and for the sea .
and then the lion for the what the prince thought he saw .
so we have the top and the bottom joined together .
and-
okay , you see- do you see the singapore river ?
so your hotel is nearby here where you see river valley road on the top left .
okay , in that vicinity is your hotel .
it 's a very pleasant walk down the river and you can- cross the road and get on to the north side .
you will be passing bars and eating places along the way .
and you can take lots of photos of yourself .
right on the edge is the merlion park .
and you can get lots of tourists or tour guides to help you take photos there .
sorry , again ?
% uh huh .
a house for a day ?
% um , i am not sure about that .
renting a house for one day % uh , i am not sure .
i ca n't confirm that .
but you can rent a room in % uh places that 's % uh are for expats settling into singapore .
do you know what i mean ?
% uh huh .
% uh yah , you having a cough , huh ?
okay , then .
i 'm glad .
i hope you will think about staying five days and not just one day .
okay .
% uh huh .
your welcome .
but i do n't think you can a rent house for one day .
ac~ you said if you go to the , you know , when i told you , you take the wrong journey from the airport , there 's a holiday % um- there are holiday bungalows that you can rent .
% uh there are actually for parties for one night .
so % uh usually people rent them to throw a wild party , away from where people live , okay .
alright .
welcome .
bye .
bye .
hello .
hello , good afternoon .
my name is jeanne .
how are you ?
i 'm fine too .
yes , jeanne .
what is your name please ?
yuki .
yuki , y u k i ?
oh .
e u k e , okay that's-
% uh it 's very original .
% hm , yes .
how can i help you euke ?
okay , fourth to the sixth of april .
% uh may i know are you both in your twenties or thirties ?
okay .
% uh what is your budget for coming ?
is that for both of you or for just-
for yourself % uh-
so do you mind if you go to a budget hotel ?
okay .
okay .
and you can take public transport around singapore .
we have got very good % uh transportation system by rail .
mass rapid transit and also by buses .
% uh they 're all air conditioned .
so your thousand dollars could % uh very well % uh be enough for the both of you .
it 's just for the land arrangement , right ?
airfare , i think there are various airlines % um . you might want to- can you travel on cebu air ?
are you able to from where you are ?
yes , that 's right .
okay .
i 'm on the cebu pacific website now or rather i 'm trying to get on to it .
% uh it would be a round trip ticket .
it 's origin would be- is it manila ?
manila and your destination is singapore .
okay .
and departure date is the fourth of april .
okay .
yah .
okay , just give me a moment .
i 'm a catholic .
is it- are you too ?
many of my filipino friends are .
oh there are plenty .
in fact % uh ninety per cent of our choir members are catholic .
oh
so we depend on them to sing for us .
% uh okay .
oh from the airport , you can easily take the mass rapid transit that we call the mrt .
and you can come to singapore from there .
% uh you- there are .
you can but you know you have a limited budget .
if you get a guide to pick you up and send you to town by limousine and all that , it will be expensive .
it 's very easy to do a free and easy % uh by yourself when you arrived .
your two thousand dollars , if you 're just staying a few days , you could get a car to pick you up from the airport .
but let- yes , you can be picked up from the airport .
you can do all your tours privately .
% uh but let me get back to your % uh question about the fare .
you see it there ?
april the fourth on your screen ?
cebu pacific air .
from manila to singapore .
so those are all the flights .
and % uh unfortunately because maybe it 's so close to the date-
% um the promotional fares are not available but i can see here six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars .
% uh for filipino peso , i do n't know how that got % uh how that connects .
% uh what 's the-
yah , conversion .
yes , % um
for the fare ?
oh that 's high .
% uh what part of singapore are you think- what are your interests ?
okay .
we have only one zoo in singapore .
and it 's part of an organisation-
called % uh wildlife reserves .
so- yes , that 's right .
and you can visit the zoo in the day .
and then walk to the night safari which is just next door .
and you can visit the night safari to see the nocturnal animals .
let me get on their website , huh ?
just a minute .
% uh if you buy a ticket for all the attractions , it 's much cheaper .
okay .
% uh it 's % uh it depends on where you stay .
if you do n't spend a lot on your % uh hotel accommodation
you 'll be able to visit a lot of places .
yes , you can get hotels about a hundred over dollars .
you can get hotels at a thousand over dollars .
so-
% um if you save on the accommodation , then you have more money to visit attractions .
and % uh if you do n't take the taxis and you do n't hire a private guide , then you use public transport , you save a lot of money .
you have n't been around- you have n't been to singapore before , right ?
so normally we do a city tour where we bring you to the ethnic areas .
% uh like chinatown , little india .
and the malay quarter if you like where we have an old mosque .
and these are the heritage areas where the buildings are conserved for future generations to enjoy .
we would also bring you to the historic area by the singapore river .
where we have % um the merlion which is the symbol of singapore .
and you can in fact take a riverboat ride in the bay .
it 's very scenic and it 's very good for photography .
so on the tour , we would tell you things about singapore like the population .
% uh that we have a mixed culture of chinese , malays and indians we have .
buddhist , christians oh .
yes , i think it 's only in the airport that it is % uh restricted .
% uh so usually you can take pictures .
it 's just that if you are in a place of worship like a temple or a mosque % um it 's better to ask for permission from somebody who seems to be in charge .
so that you know , officially you 've got permission .
% uh usually we do n't take pictures of people who are praying but of the architecture .
% uh i beg your pardon ?
% uh okay .
% uh do 's or don'ts % um generally you do n't smoke where there 's a non-smoking area like in the restaurant .
they have only a certain part of the place where you can smoke .
de~ there 's a designated area and it says that you can smoke .
so it 's limited to a very small percentage of the total area of the restaurant .
% uh sorry , you want to use your phone while you are touring , you can .
but you ca n't use- if you hired a car , you ca n't use your phone and % uh drive at the same time .
you know what i mean ?
i think it 's more fine .
yah .
travel secret .
% uh i say get a train pass and then google for places when you 're in singapore and pick up the tourist brochures on arrival when you are at the airport .
so that even if you do n't have a computer you can look at the brochures and you can have a quick look at what you like and do n't like .
and then we have % uh people at the airport that can tell you how you can get there .
% uh if that will save you a lot of money because you do n't have to hire a cab .
you do n't have to actually hire me as a guide .
or private car because hiring someone privately will cost you more money .
you- % uh you can plan it also before you go .
let me try and get these parks for you .
it was a bit slow downloading .
yah .
% uh huh .
there is a package ticket .
i think it 's about forty five dollars or forty dollars that you can pay to visit the bird park or the zoo and the night safari .
and because you are , you know , short of time-
% uh you- i suggest that you visit the bird park on one day at the same day that you do your city tour or- you know you travel- you can travel by yourself to little india- and the ma~
yes , that 's right .
but you see the three in one special there ?
can you see ?
it 's fifty eight dollars and you visit all three .
yah .
you-
the night safari and the zoo are located next to each other .
and you just walk across the car park .
so you can visit the zoo in the afternoon .
yes , and then walk across the night safari .
and then if you 're energetic and you want to have one whole day for something else-
you could go to the bird park first in the morning .
but % eh could you speak a bit louder please ?
alright % uh-
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh i ca n't hear you .
yes .
i can guess you said morning you 're going to the bird park .
afternoon to the zoo and the night safari in the evening .
is that right ?
yes .
% uh okay , i lose you now and then .
but-
yes , okay .
i 'm getting you now .
% uh i sugg~ okay .
so when you go to the bird park , you buy the three in one ticket .
% uh normally i think you have a month to use it up .
but you can use it up within a day , it 's not a problem .
% uh if you are tired by the time you reached the night safari or the zoo , you can take a tram ride .
but it 's really nice to walk around these places .
and you just have to remember to keep your three in one ticket the minute you buy it .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh i 'm losing you .
% uh yes .
oh you 're okay , you are back .
yes .
% uh actually if you are going to walk from the zoo to the night safari you will have a limited choice of places to eat . you-
you will have a limited choice of places to eat . you- i suggest you eat inside the night safari .
restaurants .
yes then .
yes , there are restaurants and there are like burger places if you do n't want to eat a full meal .
because to do the three in one , you are a little bit limited in time .
so you might want to leave your eating for the next day .
yes , you are allowed to do it .
% uh we have also fast food outside so if you want to buy and-
while you 're walking around the zoo , you nibble on the food , it 's fine .
it 's fine , it 's not a problem .
% uh it 's just that you should be aware that you should n't leave litter around .
yes .
you should try and keep our places clean and usually people do adhere to that rule .
usually the places , there are signs to remind you not to litter and usually it 's at places where you eat .
% uh so that you are mindful and there will be lots of bins around for you .
% uh well one of the cleanest cities .
i wo n't say it is the cleanest .
% uh we do have a lot of cleaners to pick up after ourselves actually .
yah .
okay .
you want to go to the beach ?
i think one of the nicest beaches is on sentosa .
it is an island .
and this beach actually has a filipino name , it 's siloso beach .
siloso means jealous , right ? or jealousy .
siloso means jealous , right ? or jealousy .
jealousy , yah .
% uh i see .
we are not sure how that name came about .
% uh but we do have % uh very good views here , i 'll show you , of the beach .
there you go .
if you get into the island % uh there 's no charge for swimming except if you use the lockers .
that 's all .
yeah .
yes , very good .
% uh and the- you know it 's safe .
it is % uh-
yes , indeed it is very romantic .
and % uh you can also stay until the night time .
we have bus -
and restaurants there .
but if you do n't want to spend so much money , there are also % uh food stalls or rather shops that sell food that is not very expensive .
the beach , when you enter the island , it 's a two dollar charge .
and another dollar for public bus .
yes .
and one dollar if you take the public bus in which i suspect you will need to after on your visit to all the parks you 'll be a bit tired .
% uh and then on the beach , it 's free .
free , yes it 's free .
oh- we do n't have a cottage .
we usually just set up a place underneath the coconut tree or % uh some people even just-
% uh hang out at where the food places are .
yes , because we- it 's , you know , it 's very open .
it 's cool and breezy .
% uh maybe if the sun is out , it 's a bit warm .
so we try and hide under the shelter of some trees .
yah , there are resort hotels there .
but usually for the resort hotels , you stay in the hotels -
overnight .
you would have to stay at the hotels .
% uh that would burst your budget a little bit .
% uh yes .
the hotels are a few hundred dollars .
% uh then you might want to stay at the nice hotels there and you can just come out and swim .
% uh yes , i mean if you 're checking in to the hotels , you are staying at the hotels on sentosa .
you are staying on the island in the hotels .
books . you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books ?
books . you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books ?
% uh did you say museum % uh on books ?
did i hear books ?
is that right , huh ?
% uh okay .
okay .
okay , are you getting the resort now ?
so these are the hotels that are available on the ho~ on the island so that 's quite different from a budget hotel .
right ?
the other end .
let me- let me try to get it for you , huh .
april- the fourth .
on the fourth you 're coming in .
right ?
on the fourth ?
is that- sorry , i thought it 's the fourth .
it 's the fifth , is it ?
no , but if you want to stay at the hotel , do n't you want to stay- you mean you want to change hotels ?
so the fourth is the first day then ?
alright .
okay .
and % uh you are departing on the ?
sixth huh ?
okay .
okay , that 's two adults , huh ?
so let 's see if it 's available first .
you may not want to go anywhere once you stay in this hotel .
it 's really-
yes , that 's right .
so okay , these are the rates at the moment .
which is actually quite attractive , five hundred and seventy dollars .
so it 's two eight five a day .
oh .
oh it's-
yah , it 's affordable .
yes , correct .
it 's affordable .
for a resort hotel , i think it 's very affordable .
and you wanted a museum , right ?
i give you one of our nice museums .
% uh it 's the asian civilisations museum .
we- well , we have been- for years % uh thought of as a- just a fishing village until the british came-
% uh in 1819 .
and % uh we became a colony until 1942 when the japanese arrived and occupied singapore until 1945 .
but recent archaeological diggings have found that in fact there was trade here over a thousand years ago .
so we do have an earlier history that we are not very % uh familiar with because of the lack of written history .
in china , there are some records .
% um are you thinking of chinese or- indian ?
% um chicken rice is quite famous .
it 's the rice - the chicken is cooked in- boiled in soup .
and some of the- or rather the water of the soup for boiling the chicken is used for cooking the rice .
and a little bit of oil is added .
so the rice is fragrant and it 's oily and we put in the pandan 's leaf .
i think you 're familiar with that .
it has a- nice fragrance .
% uh he cooks the chicken and then he cook- he takes out the chicken and he cooks the rice separately % uh with the stock that he 's used to cook the chicken .
so you-
so when you order % uh he will chop up the portion you like whether it 's the thigh , the wing or the breast .
yes , there is-
there 's a thick % uh good quality black sauce , chinese black sauce .
and there are some restaurants that you give % uh grated ginger .
and chili .
the chili has got vinegar .
so maybe not if you 're with your girlfriend , it might be a bit stinky after that .
% uh there are restaurants .
there 's one in the east coast .
% uh a place called east coast road .
and if you come on % uh saturday , sunday % uh most filipinos are at the place called lucky plaza .
and there on the fourth or fifth floor , there are % uh places selling filipino food .
but i would n't categorise them as being restaurants .
% uh because they are more the filipino people so it 's quite affordable prices .
these places , they are i think owned by filipinos and % uh it 's just that they 're not high-end , you get what i mean ?
yes .
% uh and- well i personally know of people who get filipinos to cook for their parties .
very good food % um filipino food .
and they just do it on a personal basis but they charge for it .
oh .
so- wait .
% uh wait .
can i just show you the museums first ?
because you 're asking me the website that has come out here .
so we have- % uh in the museums , we also have sometimes temporary exhibits from other countries % uh that come in .
like we have textiles , do you see here ?
from india and- let me see .
that 's up to june so it will be here when you are here .
and we have tank shipwreck gold and ceramic , you see what i mean ?
the shipwreck that was found off indonesia has got a lot of items there that shows that there 's trade in this region % uh that passed through singapore .
yes .
and the permanent exhibits , we also have artefacts from india .
that 's the permanent .
the ones you see here are special exhibitions that are here for a short period only so they 're very special .
% uh so i-
yes .
yes , you can .
it's- % uh there is one with art and craft from sarawak jewellery % uh and % uh bas~ woven clothings that the villagers used to make .
% uh part of the exhibit is on loan from a collector who went into the jungle and bought up the items .
that 's one of my favourite places also .
and we have another museum , this one is called peranakan
% uh this is an exceptional culture .
it 's a mix of chinese and malay .
% uh no , i 'm married .
yes % uh % hm .
oh we sometimes walk along the bay , you know , by the singapore river .
and then we stop and have a sandwich or have ice cream .
there are lots of joints along the singapore river .
so it 's very relaxing .
% uh % hm % uh huh
huh % uh yes .
% uh you could visit the earlier museum -
museum i told you , the asian civilisations museum .
that is-
right by the river .
so- yes .
% uh so if you have time and you want to squeeze in two museums i suggest you go to the peranakan and then the asian civilisations .
and then in the evening , you could walk by the river .
so it 's cooler , it 's very nice .
asian civilisations .
the one where you see the tank exhibits .
when you come out , you 're looking at it .
when you come out of the museum , you 're looking at the river .
yes that 's right .
and you can also see the merlion but the merlion is crowded with tourists so if you walk the other way % uh you cross the river , you walk down there .
the merlion is the emblem of singapore % uh tourism .
% uh that 's the- that 's right .
the one that 's half-fishtail and half-lion 's head .
that 's at the mouth of the river .
yes , that 's right .
% uh that 's also a nice place to walk , it 's just that it 's not very quiet .
it's- you can see the bay , you can see % um the marina bay sands hotel which has become very iconic .
% uh lovely views that are very % uh attractive for courting couples .
i often see a lot of them there .
oh .
the finest restaurants .
you could go to the % uh swissotel the stamford .
okay .
and it 's also within the area , you go to the top of the hotel .
yah , the stamford .
it 's used to be called the westin stamford .
and right at the top where you get very good views .
it 's a restaurant .
okay .
you could also stay there if you wanted to .
okay , if you look at the map here .
can you see the map ?
% uh where you see this dot is the hotel .
and your museum is just a little bit further down .
just down here and that 's the river here .
that 's the bay .
% uh the little blue patch on your right .
pardon .
yes , that 's right .
so let me see if they have the hotel - the restaurant here .
% uh taxi fare , you mean from where ?
to ?
oh % uh which hotel did you say you wanted to stay at ?
% uh the one on the hotel - at % uh sentosa , right ?
the hotel would ac~
the hotel would actually have a % uh shuttle into town .
% um i 'm not sure if they stop you right there but where this- where swissotel is % uh they have- you see- can you see the restaurant now on your screen ?
yah .
yes , lovely , is n't it ?
and they also have convention facilities .
so-
it have .
they may if you ask the concierge .
they might be able to accommodate you .
but i know they will drop off in the town area like orchard road and also where there 's dining places .
because these are major areas % uh for shopping .
the shuttle % uh to get into the hotel is just one dollar .
% uh to- into the hotel .
% uh huh .
i- no , i do n't think they bring you right to the hotel .
you would have to pay extra for the shuttles .
the transfer- you 're talking about transfer from the hotel , right ?
you are talking about from the hotel when you arrived at the airport ?
no , it will not include .
you can get to just across the island at % uh harbourfront .
by the public transport , maybe forty minutes .
yah , forty minutes .
forty minutes .
yes or- yah , that 's because you have to make a change and i 'm % uh putting in extra for you asking for directions and all that .
it would be less than one hour .
yes , you will go very far because you 're staying only two nights .
% uh but % uh-
% uh you might have to top-up a bit for your expensive dinner .
% um yeah .
% uh okay .
yes , it 's enough .
yes , it 's more than enough .
yes .
and-
yes .
for- yah , that 's for three- all three attractions , the zoo , the bird park and the night safari .
for tour attractions , it 's a little over forty dollars i think .
no , it 's % uh very cheap .
you go on the next day in the morning free and easy after you wake up .
% uh no , it 's not for free .
you will have to pay % uh it depends if there is a special exhibit on , i believe it 's eight dollars or so .
so it 's still very cheap .
if you 're a senior citizen , you get a lot of discounts but you 're not .
oh no , it 's okay .
even if you 're a foreigner , you get the discount .
yes .
no , not much .
% uh if you hire my services , you have to pay for my services .
but like i said you could % uh easily find your way to the airport and just check in .
it's- well singapore is very safe , you do n't really need % uh for a departure .
for a guide .
yes you can but of course you can also hire the services of a guide .
yes euke .
but i keep thinking i 'm speaking to a japanese .
because of the euke .
i know .
you do n't sound japanese .
i really hope to see you with your girlfriend in singapore .
thank you .
bye .
hi , good afternoon .
% uh this is tour guide % uh number one and my name is lynnette .
and how do i address you ?
john ?
hi john .
okay .
hi , yes and how can i help you ?
is this your first trip to singapore ?
% uh what would be % uh the price range that you are talking about ?
okay , maybe i can give you % uh indication of the hotel prices here .
it 's % uh let say about a hundred fifty right to two hundred dollars or two hundred to three hundred dollars budget range .
yes , we have % uh- so which price range are we talking about ?
the hundred % uh and fifty to two hundred or slightly above two hundred to three hundred price range ?
okay .
okay % uh and would you like something right in the heart of the shopping belt or you do n't or you prefer something in % uh the residential area in singapore ?
okay .
walking from one place to another ?
okay .
so commercial district meaning % um more towards the shopping belt rather than the business district , right ?
okay .
% um there are some interesting hotels there .
okay , % uh one of the hotels that i would be able to recommend you % uh would be the rendezvous hotel .
yah .
what is the price for this hotel , is it ?
okay , we are looking approximately about just slightly over two hundred dollars .
yah , because it 's just walking to most of the % uh places .
yes , it is .
otherwise there is another hotel % uh call the grand park hotel .
i 've s~ sorry , the price range is around two hundred .
slightly below two hundred a night .
% uh yes .
% uh yes , % uh a standard room .
a standard room % uh for one room .
alright , yah , so this is the price range % uh for the hotel .
okay , % uh in this hotel itself , % uh they have a restaurant .
okay , they have a restaurant in this particular hotel .
and yes they do serve some of our cuisine .
otherwise i would also recommend to you % uh just about ten minutes ' walk from the rendezvous hotel , % um you 'll be able to get to one fullerton .
yes and there is a restaurant there that serve a unique singapore % uh food .
% uh yes , it 's called one fullerton .
yah , so % uh there is a seafood restaurant
and of course a lot of people , including the locals , like to eat % uh chili crab .
yes .
% oh what other delicacy , is it ?
okay , because we are multiracial here so we do have like the malay cuisine , % uh the chinese , the indian .
and we have another % uh food that is also a favourite of a lot people is called peranakan food .
food .
yes .
it 's in-short it will be a chinese style of cooking % uh but using % uh more malay % uh spices .
% uh i would n't say most singapore % uh food are spicy it 's these are just different cuisines % uh that we have in singapore .
so yes , but yes a lot of % uh singapore people like to eat spicy food .
yes .
to-
the zoo .
from the hotel ?
okay .
from rendezvous hotel , you can % uh walk to- or i would say either you walk or you take this mrt train from % uh city hall and you alight at raffles place mrt .
you will be alighting and walking just above five minutes to the % uh marina bay .
okay , it 's a beautiful bay .
% um you will be able to see % uh the bay front which is very pretty .
% uh and of course the marina bay sands resort , as well as the icon of singapore , we call it the merlion park .
% uh the merlion is the % uh ti~ % uh lion head with a fish tail .
okay , so that is the % um good photo % uh stops % uh for you to take some memories of singapore .
so you can do that , just walking distance .
from- or just % uh one stop away from your hotel .
% uh walking kilometres , approximately about % uh five kilometres .
so i would think % uh taking the train would be a better idea .
% uh would you want to see % uh just tourist sports ?
okay .
% uh okay in around the merli~ % uh the marina bay % uh it 's also a wa~ a nice walk because % uh you are just walking around the bay front .
% uh like i said it has interesting skyline , there are some interesting sculptures % uh along the marina bay area .
% uh and in the night time , % uh we do have a show that is % um , you do n't have to pay for this show , at the marina bay front .
% uh it 's a laser water show % uh on the marina bay itself .
but that only comes on in the night time .
and there is a very interesting museum on marina bay as well , it 's called the arts and science museum .
the arts and science museum .
arts and science museum % uh in the marina bay , okay so-
% uh it is actually just next door .
the % um building itself is shaped like a lotus flower .
okay , now i 'm showing you % uh how this arts and science museum looks like .
it shaped like % uh a lotus flower .
okay , this is the arts and science % uh museum .
so everything dedicated to arts and science and of course at certain time , % uh % eh we have special exhibit , alright .
the last exhibit was the % uh titanic exhibition .
and this is actually a world-class exhibition .
and earlier on you mention % uh you also want to do the zoo as well , right ?
alright , the zoo will be located in the northwest of singapore .
% uh and in this zoo , you will see our largest collection of the orang-utan .
yes .
% uh approximately about twenty kilometres .
yes , you will take the mrt from city hall .
you take the north line and you alight at % uh ang mo kio station .
and from there , % uh you would take a bus to go
you will go- yah yes and you take a bus to the % uh zoo .
yes , this is open in the daytime .
okay .
yes .
% uh the park actually opens at eight a.m . in the morning .
% uh six p.m .
yes , this is the singapore zoo and you will see % uh mammals in this zoo .
alright , so % uh like i said % uh lots of % uh is- we have the largest collection of the orang-utans .
% uh there is a show in the zoo % uh that you can watch .
% uh , no , it goes on every day .
alright , every day we have this show .
% uh in the morning % uh it will be eleven o'clock .
and in the afternoon it will be four p.m .
yes , so this is the % uh show which is interesting , alright ?
but our show is not like the circus kind of show .
it just % uh shows you , yah , what the animals % uh do , alright , % uh in the wild as well % uh what they do .
you will buy your ticket from the mrt train station .
we would have a ticket , a few ticket machines .
and % uh you will , they will tell you where- which location you are now at and you just tell them- you just press the button which destination you are going to stop , and the machine will tell you how much to % uh- % uh how much is the fare .
% uh you just have to use singapore money to purchase your ticket .
the machine will als~ yes , so it all depends on % uh where you 're taking from and where you are going to stop .
% uh the price range will range from a dollar forty cents % uh right up to two dollars and twenty cents .
per person .
yes .
okay , beyond the vicinity of the hotel of course there are shopping areas on orchard road % uh and then you walk to the merlion park or you take the mrt .
% uh otherwise you can % uh walk to the museum , we have the national museum out there , the % uh singapore arts museum .
or do you want to consider doing ethnic places in singapore ?
% uh which ethnic place do you want me to recommend ?
% uh which ethnic place would you want me to recommend ?
is it-
okay , % uh would i be able to introduce % uh you % uh to the indian quarters ?
a traditional indian place where the indians when they came to singapore , most of them live in this area .
so we have preserved this area and we call it little india .
yes .
so we have another area called chinatown .
and % uh this other place would be called little india .
and there is another malay area call kampong glam .
yah .
% uh well the malays in singapore of course % uh the- some of them were native in singapore .
% uh but our- some of the malay ancestors came from the nearby % uh countries of malaysia , as well as indonesia .
so we would call % eh and of course % uh , yah , the nearby islands .
generally we call this area the malay archipelo .
yes , so % uh but of course the people here , who are malay , and if they are locals here , they would have been born here .
% uh most of the people here would be third generation % uh singaporeans .
their ancestors will probably come from the nearby countries for the malays .
% uh , sorry , i do n't understand you .
provincial as in the residential area ?
okay , there is % uh hotel called % uh the link hotel .
i- l i n k. and it is located in % uh a residential area , a very old residential area % uh call tiong bahru .
it is also a very accessible location , because there is the mrt % uh that is located % um just about less than ten minutes ' walk to the mrt .
yes , about ten minutes ' walk from this hotel .
so or if you look at the % uh photograph ?
the first photograph of the front facade of the hotel , % uh this was originally residential area .
% uh it 's a building that is originally residential but they have now been converted to a hotel .
okay , the attractions near to this hotel like i mention % uh this is in a residential area .
so you would be % um going to a market , alright , that opens in the morning from % uh seven thirty to twelve o'clock .
so this market is what we call a wet market .
% uh they will sell fish , meat , fruits , vegetable in this market sold .
and you will be meeting a lot of local people % uh when you visit the market .
so it 's something i would say interesting % uh because these are not the normal % uh tourist site .
so you get- when you stay in this hotel , you get to interact with a lot of the local because majority of the people that you meet % uh around your hotel area would be local .
% uh i would n't say it 's not the normal tourist belt , you know .
because you are % uh located in an area % uh that is very much residential .
but this a nice % uh boutique hotel .
okay , % uh the rates % uh of course again it depending sometimes they do have promotions % uh in % uh certain % uh during certain dates .
alright , but it should be in the range of about two hundred % uh dollars .
% uh yes , per day .
per day meaning % uh from let say today it 's starts at two o'clock or three o'clock to the next day % uh check out eleven or twelve o'clock the next day .
yes , so % uh again we have to see whether let say if you 're going to arrive
april .
okay , let 's see whether there 's any promotion in april .
% uh which date are we talking about ?
april the ten .
okay , right .
we were going to have two adults and one kid .
okay .
alright , let see .
is there any promotions for this particular period ?
okay , this rate is not available here .
yes .
would you be able to make it for this date ?
% uh it 's just called % uh link l i n k .
hotel singapore .
yes , they have % uh online booking for this hotel yes .
so like the promotion , % oh yes they have- % oh no that is the set meal promo for that period of time in may .
% uh , yah for the month of may .
okay , and % uh we have something quite interesting out there .
% uh over the weekend a lot of people % uh would be bringing out their birds .
the owners-
birds .
just at the corner of the link hotel , you have this like % uh a birds corner .
the owners of the birds , they 'll be bringing out their birds in their cages and they
yah , so and they will-
yah , the birds yes .
so % uh the owners will just have a chit chatting session with their friends .
and the birds gets to meet their friends as well .
so it 's something a little bit unusual .
% uh again you do n't see in the mainstream kind of % uh tourist area , but you get to see this in our housing state .
or residential area .
okay .
yes , it 's a different experience for % uh the bird corners .
and % uh also % uh the market , you know , pay a visit to our market .
again it 's a different experience altogether .
and for food wise , % uh just above the market , there is % uh open-air- not open-air , it 's a non-air-condition food court .
so you can have your breakfast over there , you can have lunch or you can have dinner .
so any other thing % uh that you like to do or your son would like to do ?
yes , if you are coming in december , again it 's something different .
% uh then i would recommend that you stay right in the heart of orchard road .
% uh because in december , we light up the whole street of orchard road to the marina % uh area .
so the street looks % uh like a wonderland .
% uh and the buildings , the hotels , will be also specially decorated for christmas .
so it 's wonderful time to visit in december .
okay , you can stay at the elizabeth hotel .
that is just ten minutes ' walk up to the orchard road area .
okay , elizabeth hotel .
yah .
again it 's not like % uh that big a hotel .
and it's-
yes the rates are still affordable .
okay , i 'm showing you elizabeth hotel now .
okay , it still in the price range of about two hundred .
but it is a nice % uh small hotel % uh not that big hotel and it just walk ten minutes or less , % uh to the main % uh orchard road shopping area .
okay , so this is the elizabeth hotel and do you want me to show you % uh the christmas time , how does the street look like ?
okay , i 'm gon na show you % uh the christmas light-up % uh in % uh last year .
okay , this is how % uh the street % uh looks like .
yes , you can , it 's just % uh a walk of about ten minutes and you are in % uh orchard road .
yes .
so it 's also % uh interesting place % uh to stay and you can see this is the last year , the christmas light-up in orchard road .
it looks like a christmas wonderland , is n't it ?
yes , and every year the theme will change .
so % uh this year two zero one two would be different from last year .
so last year would be % uh all the % uh winter kind of % uh feeling .
% uh this year will be different theme and it's- the light up stretches from the beginning of orchard road right up to the marina area .
% uh it 's a pretty long stretch of road that is lighted up .
yes , just one straight road down .
% uh orchard road is a pretty straight road all the way down to the marina square .
yes .
yes , correct .
you are somewhere between- rendezvous is somewhere between orchard and the marina square area .
% uh yes , no christmas lights in april .
only in december .
are you sure you % um have % uh most of the information that you need ?
yearly basis ?
then i would recommend that you spend % uh more time % uh exploring the area .
and of course we have a lot more other interesting museums for example war museums in singapore , we have % uh nice parks % uh wetland parks , if you like something and you get wet .
specially for your kids , we have wildwest , % uh wet and wild % uh in the eastern part of singapore .
and we have recently also open-up in the eastern part of singapore northeast , % um a very interesting park % uh at the % uh pasir ris % uh area .
so these are parks which % uh again a lot more locals would be visiting .
% uh they are usually located right next to the % uh river area .
% uh not all are newly open , some are the older ones .
% uh but our latest one would be the one at pasir ris .
yes , it is % um on the east- northeast of singapore .
sure .
yah .
yes , it 's a park % uh nice to stroll around in the evening , % uh morning .
% uh we have like % uh % uh mangrove area .
% uh not just wetland , % uh you can see this is the town park ?
okay .
% uh this is not meant for swimming , it 's just a park .
but it 's just a good scenery .
see , this is very nice to walk around , there are broad walk for you to walk .
lots of greenery .
okay , so this is % uh- and we have interesting parks all over the % uh- all over singapore , alright ?
so you could see % uh a lot of the areas , the residential areas , we have one of this park so , % uh you get to see greenery , not just % uh buildings and not just shops in singapore .
yah , this is a map of singapore , okay , and we have like if you look at the % uh parameter , % uh most of this we have some parks out there .
you could see % uh the shaded area on the % uh right-hand corner ?
that 's pasir ris park .
yes , correct .
yes .
yes , sure .
so we will hope to see you soon .
alright , thanks for calling .
okay , bye .
hi , good morning .
this is % uh tour guide one and % uh my name is lynnette .
sure .
% um when do you plan to come in to singapore ?
okay .
and is there any particular interest % uh or anything that you like to see ?
okay .
and how many days will you be spending here ?
and your child is below twelve ?
alright .
okay .
so what do you- what the both of you like to do ?
okay , sure .
yes % uh-
okay % uh will you be staying in a hotel ?
alright .
and how the- yes .
cheapest .
% uh cheapest .
okay , we have like different category of hotels-
% uh in singapore .
so they range from budget hotels , backpackers % uh to of course % uh five-star hotel .
% uh so when you say cheapest % uh maybe- i have actually flashed on the screen-
% uh less then hundred to hundred and forty nine .
you know .
so this kind of pricing .
so maybe can you give me a price range ?
yes .
a hundred dollars .
% uh yes , it is still quite possible .
% uh slightly above hundred , would that be alright with you ?
okay .
% uh % uh meaning the dress code or behaviour .
okay .
for dress code % uh we dress quite casual out here unless you are going to a fine dining place .
so % um a dress or dress pants for the lady is fine .
alright .
% uh no slipper for fine dining % uh or restaurants .
% uh you do n't need to wear gowns
or cocktail dresses .
% uh for % uh normal behaviour % uh we do not encourage littering % uh anywhere in the public area .
% uh not for filipinos .
okay , for your child .
% uh well i would recommend that you can- okay , i have actually- maybe you just go back a little bit .
just now you were asking me about your hotel .
okay , on my list here , i given you some of the rates % uh for the hotel which is along your price range .
% uh so if you look down % uh the screen , i have here % uh hotel bencoolen .
alright .
that is in actually the price range of % uh hundred and % uh a hundred and ten .
alright .
okay .
i do n't really want to recommend you the other places in % uh geylang area because % uh i think it 's not so convenient .
alright .
so maybe a little bit more in terms of your budget % um . okay .
there 's one at chinatown , the inn at temple street .
okay .
% uh and that 's another one at victoria street about a hundred and thirty dollars .
% uh they are quite conveniently located where you can take the public transport to your- the places of interest .
okay , so for your son , i would like to recommend- does he like animals ?
okay .
i would like to recommend % um the zoo for him .
okay .
% uh the zoo is located in the northern part of singapore .
and % uh what he can see in the zoo would be % uh all the % uh mammals , a lot of mammals .
% uh like the orang-utan .
% uh sorry , what do you say ?
a bus ?
do you say a bus ?
yes ?
okay .
from the hotels that i recommended-
% uh you can always go to the city hall mrt .
at the mrt , it 's a subway .
and you take the north line towards ang mo kio station and from ang mo kio , you change a bus- a public bus .
% uh bus number one three eight .
do you know how to take the public transport ?
alright .
for the mrt , you pay according to the distance travelled .
so you will buy a ticket .
% uh when you arrived at the station % uh in- within the busy areas like the vicinity of the city hall area to the orchard area .
% uh the mrt runs beneath the road .
so you go down to the basement area .
and there would be a ticket machine .
% uh you will have to carry some singapore money with you if you want to take our public transport .
% uh yes .
so you just % uh press a button to tell you the- to tell the computer % uh the machine which station are you going to alight .
and the machine will tell you how much money % uh the fare will be .
alright .
% uh well % uh i would recommend you to change some singapore money .
% uh if you are going to take % uh public transport .
% uh in case you want to buy some street food .
so i would recommend that you change % um money into singapore money .
% uh are you talking about us dollars ?
okay , from us dollars to singapore dollars % uh the rate now is approximately about one singapore dollars will give you approximately % uh a dollar % uh twenty seven cents us % uh- sorry .
% uh one us dollar would give you approximately about a one dollar twenty seven cents-
singapore money .
% uh for the period of april , we do not have any major festivals coming up .
yah .
okay , the- i would say- well it 's very festive and a lot of people % uh are very busy preparing for the festival .
i would say it % uh will be among our major festival like chinese new year sometime in january
% uh period the- % uh preparation before % uh the actual festival .
and also the % uh festival that 's celebrated by the malays will be hari raya .
okay .
and also deepavali in november .
and % uh christmas time in december .
so i have put on the screen our public holidays calendar for this year .
chinese new year is over now .
% uh it was celebrated on the twenty third and twenty fourth .
so the whole month of january was very busy in chinatown .
% uh may , we have vesak day .
alright .
% uh no major preparation before vesak day .
% uh the next % uh major festival would be hari raya in august .
and deepavali in the month of november .
alright .
so this will be more % um- i would say the major festival where you will see a lot more preparation % um and a very carnival festive mood % uh just before this public holidays .
% uh nature as in plants or in birds or fishes ?
or coral- i mean % uh marine life ?
see some nature .
okay .
well i would like to recommend you this % uh hill which is at- a very popular hill in singapore , for the local as well .
alright .
we call it the bukit timah nature reserve .
this is our tallest hill in singapore .
okay , you can see some pictures now ?
% uh and in fact our bukit timah nature reserve has one of the % um- a lot of % uh flora and fauna as you climb up the hill .
but as- if you are too tired , you can always turn around and there will be some small animals that you will see along the way .
okay , so this is the bukit timah .
okay .
there 's no entrance fee % um and it would be better if you either go in the morning or the evening .
% uh well of course % uh dress comfortably , good walking shoes .
% uh bring water with you and also hat with you .
okay .
and of course do not wander off the normal trail .
that means if there 's no trail , do not walk on those trail .
so just do the normal walkway and there are also walking trail , there will be signs that this is a walking trail .
do not wander off the normal walking trail and you will be fine .
it is % uh quite a popular hill .
so there will be- usually % uh some people that you will meet along the way .
it 's just not like so quiet that you do n't see anybody at all .
okay , for the bukit nature reserve park % uh we do n't have any % uh restaurants out there but just across the road % uh there are quite a few eating places .
so when you alight % uh when you climb down from the tree- % uh from the hill , just go across the road and there will be quite a lot of eating places out there .
% uh restaurants as well as non-air conditioned % uh we call it coffee shops .
so maybe- yes , so maybe at the same time if you 're going to climb % uh bukit timah you can also bring along some snacks with you .
% uh just also % uh be careful , do n't put your food items in plastic bag .
put them inside your bag because % uh there will be some monkeys on the hill .
and they will think that , you know , your plastic bag would have contained food and they may % um disturb you .
okay , i mentioned earlier on % uh i would like to recommend the zoo -
% uh for your % uh child because % uh our zoo is very nice .
and it- % uh the animals are not keep- are not kept in % uh cages .
so it 's an open zoo .
he will get to see or you will get to see elephants , orang-utans .
% uh in fact singapore zoo has the largest collection of orang-utan .
so i 'm showing you the- % uh okay , i will show you the % uh attractions-
% uh that can be found in the zoo .
okay .
i think this will interest him , the polar bear .
% uh yes .
% uh well i would say that you have to be selective .
% uh we have so many things to see in singapore so if it 's just a one day programme-
then you can do a three hours tour of the zoo .
or you can do at morning , the bukit timah hill and have a lunch in % uh one of our local non-air conditioned to the zoo .
alright .
and in lunch time , you can actually do a relaxing river cruise on the singapore river .
okay , so i will just show you % uh the river cruise .
% uh just a short ride on the singapore river .
so that will be something quite relaxing .
and after your river cruise , you could have a dinner .
yes , you can see the boat now ?
on this kind of river cruise , it 's about a half an hour cruise .
and you could alight at the- this is the % uh the clarke quay area or boat quay area and have a nice dinner .
the cruise will cost you fifteen dollars for an adult .
and for your child , it will be eight dollars singapore money .
% uh no . on the cruise itself , there 's no food provided .
it 's just a cruise on the singapore river .
so it 's just half an hour ride .
and there will be a commentary % uh on the cruise itself to tell you what you are looking at on the left and right-hand side of the % uh places that you 're going to pass by .
alright .
the cruise- yes , this is the cruise that i 'm talking about .
it 's a chinese looking kind of a boat .
okay .
the cruise like i mentioned is only a half an hour ride .
% uh you will pass by some of the highlight , the financial district area .
% uh so you see a lot of skyscrapers .
and % uh you will see % uh bridges .
alright , old bridges in singapore .
and you will also get to see % uh- you will also get to see % uh the old warehouses .
% um and of course the icon of singapore , the merlion .
okay .
so on- this is what you are going to see % uh on the cruise .
so it 's just a short cruise .
if you look on the right-hand side % uh can you see the blue shaded area ?
okay , this is actually the singapore river .
okay , so you will be travelling out this way , out to the marina bay .
okay .
now i 'm gon na just show you this picture here .
okay , now , you can see ?
alright .
so this is the boat that 's going to % uh travel on the singapore river , you 're going to see % uh this scene .
okay .
% uh now , the houses that 's yellow in colour % uh that is actually clarke quay .
so i 'm saying that when the boat gets stopped back , you can go for a dinner , a nice dinner .
whether you choose to have a fine dining or casual place cafe there are all % uh kind of food there including spanish , mexican , indian chinese , seafood , barbecue .
they 're all found there .
so you can walk around and choose a restaurant that you like .
alright .
so this is what you 're going to see % uh on the cruise itself .
and % uh of course they- when you come out of the bay , you will see the merlion % uh icon .
oh .
our language of administration here is english so our street sign % uh will be english .
all our documents will be english .
the menu % um given to you by the restaurants will also be written in english .
all service staff will be speaking english .
% uh for one day ?
okay this is the programme that i would say % uh it has something for your son to do .
as well as % uh a little bit of relaxing cruise in the night time .
but of course there are lots of other things that you can do in singapore .
for example , we have universal studio in sentosa .
% uh you could also do that instead of doing the zoo .
% um in the afternoon , you could go over to sentosa and do universal studio in the afternoon .
okay .
the highlight , i think % uh that will be different .
there are other % uh stu- % uh universal studios do not have would be the latest ride , it 's called transformer .
okay .
so this is quite an exciting ride % uh for you and your son .
yah , this is the ride that i 'm talking about .
so there are seven zones % uh to explore in universal % uh studio .
you can see there 's hollywood , new york , sci-fi , ancient egypt and lost world and far far away and madagascar .
alright .
so these are the seven zone % uh that you can visit in universal studio .
okay .
you can see all these are the scene % uh street scene of universal studio .
so there are lots of rides there as well .
% uh for both your son and yourself or more for your son ?
more for your son ?
% uh alright .
i would % uh recommend to you % uh to bring him to the science centre in singapore .
it 's % um- it will be suitable for a young % uh person .
okay , and- yes ?
yes , the admission charges % uh for the science centre % uh would be-
nine dollars for an adult and five dollars for the children- for the child .
and it is located in the western part of singapore .
do you need me to give you direction how to get there ?
okay .
now % um i will always come back to city hall mrt -
because this is one of our interchange .
and % uh it 's the interchange between the east and the west line .
% uh so because we have not chosen the hotel yet , so i will just- for reference , go back to city hall .
from city hall , you take the west line and you alight at jurong east mrt train station .
from there when you come out , you will just walk about ten minutes and you get to the singapore science centre .
% uh what do you say ?
oh beach .
yes , we do have beach on the mainland .
% uh but it is- it will be just a simple beach .
and % uh- yes .
okay , i will show you the % uh beaches in singapore .
% uh this is in the east coast so it 's just a simple beach .
alright .
% uh it 's a little bit rocky over in the % uh east coast and also the changi beach % uh of singapore .
do you want to go there for swimming or- is it for swimming ?
oh for swimming , okay .
% uh well , the changi beach and the east coast beach % um will not be fine sand .
alright , it 's a little bit rocky .
the sand is a little bit % um coarse .
but % uh on saturdays afternoon and sundays afternoon , the- you will see more local people going there for swimming .
otherwise we have % uh better beaches over on sentosa island .
like % uh palawan as well as % uh siloso beach over on the sentosa island .
% uh okay , if you intend to extend your holidays in singapore , of course like i said there 's a lot more things to do .
% uh now , i 'm actually showing you a map of sentosa .
but for one day % uh you really have to be very selective so we do have other museums in singapore or like the national museum which highlights the % uh history of singapore .
% uh arts museum % uh where you see contemporary art .
% um war museum .
okay , if your son is interested % uh to know a little bit about the war because singapore was occupied by the japanese .
% uh we do have quite a few war museums as well .
% um so for visits to museum , well , depending on how big the museum is .
minimum one to three hours , alright , would be sufficient .
okay .
% uh normally for immigration , we give a one month % uh visitor pass .
so you seems to be concerned about some rules and regulation with singapore .
% uh okay .
like i said % uh we do not encourage littering .
% um % uh so if you does any litter , please throw them into the % uh litter bins , the rubbish bin .
% uh for lighting of % uh cigarette , there are quite a few restriction now including the airport .
so % um in short , very simple , anything that 's indoor , in the restaurants , yes , we do not allow % uh cigarettes to be lighted up .
% uh including bus stop .
so there must be % uh- like an area % uh from the- enclosed area that you can do % uh light up of cigarettes .
% uh yes .
so i think these are the major concern otherwise % uh crime rate here is pretty low .
% uh you are able to move around quite freely even in the night time .
as usual just avoid all the dark lanes % um and do not carry too much cash with you .
% uh that then you will be having a very enjoyable time in singapore .
okay , the night safari opens in the night time .
from seven thirty to eight o'clock .
again it is an open night safari , you wo n't see cages in this night safari .
it is just next door to the zoo .
okay , so if your son is really into animals , you could do the afternoon zoo .
at night , you could bring him over just next door to the night safari .
now if you look at the first picture .
% uh this is a tram that brings you around the night safari .
so that you are not too tired .
you don ' have to walk the entire park .
and on this two tram ride itself , of course you see about seventy per cent of the animals .
it will be different from what you see in the zoo .
so you see the leopards here , the malayan tapir , the fishing cat .
and if you are not too tired , you can do a walk- short walk in the middle of the tram ride , there is- the tram will stop , you can do a walking trail towards the leopard area .
% uh that will take you about forty minutes .
half an hour to forty minutes and you go back to the tram station and board back the next tram .
that will bring you back to the entrance area and you can do another walking trail called the fishing cat trail .
alright .
so- and if you are not too tired again , there is a forest giant trail .
again , from the entrance area that you can walk .
alright , fishing cat trail , about twenty minutes .
and if you want to see some shows , we do have two shows in the night safari .
% uh but usually there 's a long queue to see the creatures of the night show .
this is a show . it 's a-
this is a show . it 's a- just a twenty minute show- thirty minute show .
and they will bring in some animals % uh the smaller animals % uh for the audience to look at .
okay , the admission fee for the night safari will be thirty two dollars for the adult .
and the child will be twenty one dollars .
yes , we call our % uh ocean park , the underwater world .
alright .
and this is located in % um sentosa island .
okay , the underworld is located on sentosa island .
so i 'm now flashing you some of the photographs taken in the underwater world .
now over here % uh the highlight would be- you go into the basement area .
you step on the travelator and you were actually in an underground % uh tank , a very big tank .
so inside the travelator , you will get to see sharks , alright .
stingray and lots of other kinds of fishes .
% uh in this underwater world , you do n't have to walk .
alright , the travelator will bring you around .
% uh you can really get to see a lot of % uh marine life when you 're in this % uh travelator .
now besides this travelator , if you look at the bottom right-hand corner .
these are what we call mimicry .
you see this % uh yellow colour looking marine life ?
okay .
now it 's on the screen now .
now if this marine- cry- % uh marine % uh sea creature , it 's among the seaweeds .
you can really miss this marine % uh sea creature .
alright , they actually looks like a seaweed or a plant .
yes .
but actually if it 's among the plant , you ca n't even miss this % um % uh sea creature .
okay , so these are just some of the sea marine life that you would see in the underwater world .
but this is on sentosa island .
so if you 're going to choose sentosa , then you can do the beach , the underwater world and the universal studio all in one day because they 're in the same location .
% uh no . because when you come in to singapore , our immigration officers % uh would normally give you a one month stay in singapore .
so there 's no need to extend it % uh your stay in singapore .
but do check on your passport , you know , what is the validity that 's given to you .
but i would say normally one month .
okay , if you forgot , alright % uh to see what is your length of stay in singapore and you overstayed in singapore , then please bring your passport and yourself to our immigration office in lavender % uh street .
alright , we have an immigration % uh office there .
and tell them % uh your situation .
alright .
for- if you intend to visit the universal studio , i will recommend that you book your tickets online first just in case , you know , that day happens to be a very crowded day because we do have a limit % uh as in % uh visitors % uh going into the universal studio .
% uh to the universal studio , for the adult on a weekday , it will be sixty eight dollars .
% uh weekends , public holidays , will be seventy four dollars .
for the child , it will be fifty dollars .
and weekend will be % uh fifty four % uh dollars .
% uh also for % uh certain rides in the universal studio , there 's a height limit .
% uh for certain rides like roller coaster , the child would be have- % uh to be approximately about % uh one point two % uh metres tall .
okay , for certain rides in the park .
so i hope you will- you know % uh visit us soon .
alright .
welcome .
bye .
hell~
hell~ hi .
hi cris .
good morning .
my name is jeanne .
how can i help you ?
% uh , did you say that it 's for three people ?
% uh can i just have your profile what is your age group ?
are you in your twenties ?
thirties or-
one child then more or less ?
% ah okay .
% um , what are your % uh dates of travel ?
do you- have you planned or is it open ?
% oh twenty-ninth to thirtieth , % uh-
so that 's only one night you can actually stay two nights , right ?
% uh mar~ are there thirty one days in march ?
you could stay till april the first .
% uh , okay let 's see .
are you willing to stay % uh at a budget hotel ?
because you have a thirteen-year-old ?
if you 're willing to stay at % uh dormitories , your thousand dollars will be able to accommodate all three of you .
that means you only pay about twenty to % uh maybe thirty , forty dollars a room night .
but you % uh the toilets would be outside , you know what i mean ?
you are sh~ having shared toilets .
% uh , so what you want is actually small rooms ?
with a toilet attached , huh ?
okay .
alright .
but the rooms will not be large .
wait .
let me see , huh ?
% uh you have a chaperone , huh ?
for your girlfriend .
let me just check for you .
% uh , yes .
do you like gardens ?
there is a place i know .
it 's called hortpark .
h o r t short for horticultural .
and it is a~ it is~
% uh that is in there a little % uh structure that 's made of trees that have been formed to look like a little~ very small building .
and % uh hortpark in fact allows you to use the rooms for a formal wedding proposal .
but you can use that little garden area without paying for the room if you are not using the room because you are not inviting all your friends , right ?
so , i think there will be no charge for that .
you just % uh go there .
you may just have to bear with maybe visitors looking at you .
% oh that would be very romantic . % um-
and the only thing is you have to % uh-
you have to maybe bring a big umbrella in case it rains .
% uh when it is , you know , % uh when you have finished proposing and it starts to rain .
you just tell her that in singapore we consider rain to be good fortune .
because we all need rain , do n't we ?
you can take a bus .
and % uh you can reach the outside of the park
there are clear signs .
and then you walk in and it 's very romantic because as you walk in , it 's % uh
the pathway just outside is called the floral walk .
so you have flowers and plants
you can take a lot of photos on your way in .
and-
the- % uh yes .
that 's a good idea . % uh-
until april one ?
i 'm trying to get a fairly nice hotel .
but in chinatown we do have boutique hotels that would cost you a bit more .
okay % um-
i 'm just trying to find you a room that can put in an extra bed for your girlfriend 's brother .
% uh the hotels - yah .
the hotels in chinatown tend to be rather % uh small because they are converted from-
restored shophouses .
okay .
there is a very good hotel which is actually four or five-star .
and the price to me it is quite reasonable .
% uh , it 's in fact a boutique hotel .
it 's called hotel nineteen twenty nine .
it is run by a young man who loves taking old buildings and converting them .
and- in this one % um they have a rooftop garden where you can also propose to her if you like .
% uh the-
on the website , it 's just a little over two hundred dollars .
yes .
% uh they have a suite room .
% uh and it has a long bath-
% uh on the balcony .
but i have seen it the bal- the- where the long bath is .
it is shielded by plants .
and they claimed they have done research where the tall buildings , you know , they overlook but they ca n't really see you bathing .
% uh so it 's very unique .
% uh so you may call it a budget hotel but it 's also known as a boutique hotel .
so maybe that is the most romantic place for you .
i- yes .
yes .
% uh , do you see it on your screen ?
okay .
i also have another titbit for you .
keong saik road in my father 's and grandfather 's time was a red-light district .
but it is all cleaned up now and that 's why we have hotels there .
okay .
% um let me get you the mass rapid transit map .
souvenirs will be all around .
it would be-
% uh you would be in chinatown .
so it 's very easy for you .
i am getting you the map now .
and so since you have quite a nice hotel % uh i suggest you come in by train .
and use the trains and the buses to move around because many of our buses like ninety nine point nine nine are- per cent are air-conditioned .
almost all are air-conditioned now .
% uh unless the air conditioner % uh breaks down .
% uh and some of them are double-decker buses so you 're on % uh upper deck you can have a very good view .
okay .
can you see the map now ?
okay .
can you see on the right-hand side sort of in the middle can you see changi airport at number three ?
okay .
that 's where you would start taking your train ride .
so what you do is when you arrived , change your money at the airport .
and go down to the basement .
there are signs leading you % uh to the mrt .
it 's mass rapid transit .
that 's the name of our rail system .
so there you approach the officer and buy a ez-link ticket .
wha~ yes .
that will allow you to use the buses and trains and you also get a discount . % uh ins~
and you also get a discount . % uh ins~ and if you use cash , it 's a bit more expensive .
because % uh after you stored value when you return , they charge you a small fee for the manufacture of the card but you get your refund back of the unused portion .
yes .
that 's right .
you buy for all three of you .
you will have to buy adult tickets because the thirteen-year-old is not a student in singapore .
he 's not a young child .
he is not , you know , if he 's six or seven , you can get a child ticket but he has to get adult ticket .
so you take your green line and you follow it down to city hall .
yes .
city hall is % uh one of the interchange stations and you- if you like % uh on another day , you can get off there and have a look around there .
but otherwise , you continue down to- no , let me see .
yes .
you get off at city hall and you switch to the red line to dhoby ghaut .
can you see dhoby ghaut at number eight ?
yes .
% uh dhoby ghaut is where three lines meet .
can you see ?
so it 's also- yah .
it 's also a very big shopping centre % uh with restaurants , cafes .
a little garden nearby as well .
so at dhoby ghaut you will just take two stops down to chinatown .
e~ it 's very fast on the trains .
% uh maybe forty minutes considering you come in at non peak hours where you wait two minutes more for the train .
and you are not staying too many days so you just carry a backpack or , you know , small luggage you can-
as you walk to your hotel , you can look around at the shops in chinatown places you might want to come back to eat , to shop .
% uh affordable but you want to bring your girlfriend there , right ?
do you mind chinese food ?
this is a very special chinese food .
% uh it 's right in the heart of chinatown and the restaurant is called lee kui % uh ( ah hoi ) .
% uh it 's in a street called mosque street .
i 'm trying to see if they have it on the website otherwise i can tell you i have a brochure here which makes me want to go there to eat tonight .
% uh okay .
they ha~ this is a dialect cuisine called teochew .
and we have % uh crab .
% uh we also have % uh it's- the crab is cold crab .
are you familiar with cold crab ?
% uh it-
i- % uh it 's a special dialect kind of food .
the cold crab is tasty .
people are used to chili crab .
but if you do n't like chili , this is a little bit % uh closer to not hurting your taste buds .
% uh it has got gravy to go with it as well
% uh except that the cold crab is in fact raw .
but it is soaked in vinegar .
i do n't know if you like vinegar .
i love vinegar so i like this dish .
well no . that one is cooked .
and you have a lot of chili in it .
okay .
alright then .
% uh there is also something called jelly pork .
% uh the pork , you know , when you cook , you get these gravies that form a jelly ?
and it 's very tasty .
so it 's almost like you 're eating a dessert that is savoury in taste .
three people % um maybe seventy dollars i would think .
it depends on how big is your appetite how much you order .
% uh they have also something like deep fried pork and liver roll .
and % uh yam paste .
% uh yam paste is quite a sweet dessert .
the yam is cooked % uh that would be the ending of your meal .
so if you have eaten too much , you can skip the dessert .
yes that-
yah .
that would be quite nice .
i think it 's a little bit like a filipino type of dessert .
it 's % uh sweet and it 's sticky , you know .
yes .
all over .
when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road , you will find that there are lots of little streets leading off the main road that is called north bridge road .
and they have stalls set up along the road so you can check out the stalls .
ha~ % uh t-shirts are just a few dollars .
% uh they are not the high end sort .
and you can also buy souvenirs like ten dollars for three souvenirs .
and they would be all different kinds , different colours .
universal studios , yes .
let me get you the mrt map again .
okay .
well- all along the same street , there are other restaurants .
so you can just , you know , walk through and have a look .
and quite often in chinatown , they display their menu outside so you can gauge what the actual prices of the food you are going to eat will cost .
what i 'm giving you is just an estimate .
okay .
% uh let me show you .
% uh are you hearing me ?
okay .
let me show you first from your hotel in chinatown to go to the place i recommended for you to do your proposal , if you do n't want to do it at the rooftop of your hotel , okay ? % uh-
so you take the % um line- the blue line right down to harbourfront .
can you see that ?
and here is the start of the north east line .
so you switch , you go to the circle line which is the yellow line .
and you move along to just one stop in fact .
% uh one or two stops , it does n't make a difference .
either telok blangah or labrador , you get off % uh the bus - % uh get off the train and you get on to a bus .
% uh when you reached the bus stop at the back , there will be signs to tell you the buses that stops there and the route it 's going .
yes and hortpark .
which is just one street down .
so the bus will make a turn and it will drop you almost in front- in fact it is in front of this garden that i 'm telling you about .
yah .
yes .
very good .
% uh that will be a very nice romantic setting .
and it should n't be too crowded .
% uh it will give you a little bit of privacy .
you just need to bring maybe if you want to bring snacks or something % uh you can have a little picnic .
if you walk into the garden , there are sheltered areas there .
and bring your camera , you can take lots of photos .
yes you are .
you just need to bring a plastic bag to make sure you collect all your leftover % uh crackers or cups and then you dispose them in the proper bins .
okay .
you see the same blue line from chinatown ?
so this time you take it to harbourfront but you walk to the bus terminals % uh which is % uh just nearby .
and you will also pass a food centre , so you might want to check out some of the local foods there .
we have a lot of % uh muslim food and we also have my favourite fish soup stall there in the middle of the food centre .
but if you 're in a hurry then you just go just behind the food centre a few steps away to the bus bay right at the corner next to the mrt station and you board a shuttle bus that goes into sentosa directly .
% uh you can also cross the road and take the light rail but i think this way it 's much easier .
yes that 's right .
% uh sentosa itself is only two dollars to enter
and one dollar for your bus ride .
and when you come out- % uh you are not given tickets when you come out , it 's free of charge to take the buses out .
now i 'm showing you universal studios now .
yes .
there is an entrance fee .
% uh you can buy a package .
sometimes they have- % uh during certain promotions , they give you special prices .
but yah % um you are not coming on a public holiday , right ?
it 's not the easter weekend .
it is the easter weekend .
it is .
% um can you see the prices there ?
i suggest you budget at these prices first .
% uh at the highest so that you , you know it will cost you seventy four dollars % uh each for you and your girlfriend and- % oh actually for all three of you .
so it's-
two hundred .
it 's two hundred and twenty two .
yes .
it 's all still on the budget .
and if you want to eat in chinatown at the food centre 's % uh street side it 's very cheap .
it 's under ten dollars for each of you .
% uh noodles would be about four dollars , rice for five dollars the most .
you can- you will take lots of pictures in this area .
it 's very pretty .
% uh not only within universal studios but on the island as well .
% uh do you notice they have a two-day package and a three-day package ?
so if you were to visit all the attractions , one day is not enough .
that 's right . i-
that 's right . i-
and i suggest you skip the casino .
although for you as a tourist to enter , it is free of charge to enter to gamble .
you could enter just to have a look and then come out again .
you might want to propose to your girlfriend first because a visit to sentosa % uh may tire her for the next day .
so % uh propose to her and then the second day you can bring her to universal studios .
yah .
that 's right .
and you 'd be very happy after you get your yes answer .
what else do you think % uh you would like to do in singapore ?
okay .
the merlion statue - % uh let me get on to the mrt map for you .
okay .
so say you 're at your hotel here in chinatown .
you go down to the green line and then you switch east bound to city hall .
and you get off there .
that 's a very interesting historic area .
% uh before you go to the merlion , you will be passing by our supreme court and city hall .
% uh although they are now- right now being % uh renovated to be turned into the singapore % uh art museum - % oh sorry , the singapore - a big museum for singaporeans to enjoy .
both of them would be combined .
% um you can walk from there towards the seaward side and % uh you would be able to see the merlion .
you walk across a big field across from where they are renovating these two buildings .
and you get to see views % uh of the hotel marina bay sands .
very scenic .
say again please ?
are you thinking of ethnic areas % uh also ?
okay .
besides chinatown - well for history first , by the river , that 's very historic place because % uh where the merlion is % uh nearby is the start of the mouth of the singapore river .
and that 's where sir stamford raffles landed which he 's a british who came here to look for a trading port .
so and the whole riverside , the buildings have been conserved .
so it 's an interesting walk , huh .
% uh you could walk in fact along the river or you could from your hotel in chinatown take the line to little india and soak in some indian culture in that area .
i-
to little india % uh usually two stops about 5 minutes .
but on this line .
so maybe seven or eight minutes but % uh you have to factor in walking down to the station in getting out so maybe twenty minutes .
yes that 's right .
% uh you go there- % uh try and go there in the morning where many people are marketing .
you can take photos of the flower garland makers , the % uh vegetable sellers and visit the hindu temples before twelve o'clock .
because they- yah they close around twelve to about four o'clock and then they reopen .
but if you missed it , you can go back later in the % uh around four something .
and it is open till nine o'clock .
and you can eat there also since you say you like chili .
% uh but in the- % uh little india has lots of sweets also milk-based sweets in the same area .
you can both be very happy .
e~ there is also dessert stall in chinatown % uh that specialises in % uh pureed sesame paste and pureed peanut paste
% uh just about one street away from where you are .
the area where the merlion is , is actually where we have the seafront .
% uh but the seafront that you see is now a reservoir to collect rainwater that falls in the city area and also to prevent flooding .
% uh if you want to walk , i think on men~ sentosa % uh after you visit universal studios , take a walk along the beach , that would be better .
historical places .
if you want- % uh what sort of history do you want ?
war history or do you want to see a museum about % uh local lifestyle ?
okay .
okay that is very % um convenient because right in chinatown , we have the chinatown heritage % uh centre which shows you life in a building like yours but in its original form .
so it 's called the chinatown heritage centre and it 's right where you are , you just walk two streets down .
% uh the museum is accessible by bus and by train .
it 's called the changi prison museum or changi museum .
you take the west line % uh right down to like just hold on a minute .
you can actually go by bus all the way , number two bus .
and you can have sight see along the way .
but % uh if you prefer to go there faster , you take a train % uh to tanah merah .
sorry .
yah tanah merah .
and then you switch to number two bus .
and you are right outside the museum .
yes .
that 's what you 're buying it for , for the trains and buses and the buses .
% uh huh .
so you do n't worry about % uh carrying loose change on knowing how much , you know .
so fix your problem .
% uh to stroll around and take pictures would be the areas i have recommended .
if you want % uh garden , do you like gardens % uh besides hortpark ?
we have another garden that is very famous and older one .
and from harbourfront , you take the yellow line all the way to botanic gardens .
that 's also quite romantic for proposal but it would be busier .
i think there will be more people around and % uh-
it's- also more of % uh open space whereas if you reached hortpark and it 's raining , they have a big covered area near the entrance where you can wait out the rain and you can walk to this place where i said you can propose to your girlfriend .
you-
i- another part of history that you might like to visit , it is % uh a museum that is near to the city hall stop .
and it 's also near the merlion and it 's called the asian civilisation 's museum .
so it gives you not only the history of singapore but of % uh- well we have artefacts from india , from china and also from the middle east .
% uh not inside the museum because , you know , when you have your camera flash on , it 's % uh it fades the photograph- % uh the exhibits .
and i- maybe for security also , they usually do not allow photography inside .
yes .
% uh inside if you want to see the history of singapore only % uh there is a foyer on the upstairs level , you can take the lift or walk up the stairs .
and that 's free of charge .
you are most welcome .
% uh do you need anything else ?
% uh maybe you want to go to a church or anything else ?
okay .
because in that area , we also have an anglican church , catholic churches .
% uh when you get off at city hall , they are all within walking distance of that area .
% uh what sort of a christian are you ?
born again christian .
% uh i 'm not so familiar with % uh-
wha~ yes evangelist .
we have new creation church and new life church .
but i 'm not so good with % uh-
yah .
% uh i am not sure about the protestant churches but % uh in the catholic churches they allow you .
and the catholic and anglican churches have lots of statues inside , you know , of their saints .
% uh let me show you a picture of one of them .
yes , saint andrews .
this is a church of england , anglican church .
it 's a- yah .
it 's a national monument .
and we also have a bit of war history on the walls .
% uh because % uh during the war , the british were here and some died and so people put up plaques in church to remember them .
yes .
% uh it is in fact shaped like a cross if you are in a helicopter above it .
and it 's a very active church . they-
and it 's a very active church . they- in fact they have a little sunken area nearby .
because they can not expand the church because it 's a protected building .
so there is a sunken area on the other side of the building where they have % uh- they use for other purposes when they have not enough space within the church .
% uh the catholic churches are just within walking distance across the road from there .
and they were all built in the eighteen hundreds , early nineteen hundreds .
so they are a bit like this .
in fact more on it because , you know , catholics have lots of statues of saints .
and the way of the cross along the walls , so it 's great for photography .
the priest will allow it .
% oh you just take the % uh line to city hall station .
and when you get off , i believe there 's even a sign to tell you where this building is .
yah .
the night market would be in chinatown but the bars i would suggest along the singapore river .
% uh you just walk along the river .
there are many % uh restaurants and some are just- you know sports bars where they watch % uh games ?
there 's a huge tv screen and you can watch international matches .
and then % uh some of them are supported by certain people who like certain teams .
and they go and cheer their team on .
although that is not held in singapore .
so there 's a great atmosphere there .
i would suggest along the singapore river .
again as i said the prices there are quite competitive because there are so many of them .
so you can just walk along and % uh you can in fact ask the prices before you go in .
% uh in fact some of them , they just put up a sign to say % uh so many dollars for a jug of beer .
% uh ten of fifteen dollars because they want to show that they are not expensive .
yes .
% uh so , you know , because people like you have the same idea that it looks expensive .
because expatriate community are also seen there .
but it 's not actually .
% uh there is one bar i like there .
it 's called % uh penny black .
you know the first stamp in the world is called the penny black ?
and- % uh it 's at the start of the river .
% uh you can also eat there if you like .
they have got very good fish and chips if you % uh do n't mind eating that . not very singaporean .
eating that . not very singaporean .
yes .
okay .
can you see on your screen the three quays we have along the river ?
so boat quay is at the start of the river .
and the penny black is there right at the start .
it 's quite an old bar .
and you find lots of people there .
it 's affordable .
it 's not expensive .
and then-
and at clarke quay , % uh lots of places to eat .
% uh retail shops .
% uh at clarke quay , you get many retail shops besides the bars and the restaurants .
an- no . not at clarke quay .
clarke quay is a bit more upscale than a food court .
if you-
if you want a market , go to maxwell market in chinatown .
there the food will cost only about three to five dollars a dish depending on % uh what is inside the dish .
and clarke quay is- and boat quay - we also have robertson quay .
these places are best visited in the evenings .
% uh along the river .
i- so from the merlion , you go to boat quay first .
and then you go to clarke quay .
and robertson quay is the last quay there .
it 's more laid back .
it 's a little bit quieter here at robertson quay .
yes .
% uh normal price is about % uh ninety eight dollars for one hour .
% uh full body massage but sometimes they will offer it first time trial for thirty eight dollars .
% uh you can just walk by yourself to visit the hindu temples in little india .
in chinatown , we have a fairly new temple called the buddha tooth relic temple .
and the oldest temple which is one street away called teluk- at teluk ayer street is called % um thian hock keng temple .
and it 's within walking distance from where you are .
are you talking about shopping malls ?
there are very many famous malls in singapore but-
okay . um-
okay . um-
as you are going to sentosa % uh just before you come back , if you take the light rail instead of the bus out , it 's only a small fee , two dollars also i think .
you get off at vivo city .
it 's spelt v i v o city .
and it 's a huge shopping mall .
so wait , what you see on the screen is the buddha tooth relic temple and museum which is walking distance from your hotel .
yes .
you just walk there .
so you buy your souvenirs and you end up at a % uh temple and the museum .
% uh now you want to have- do you want to see the other temple ?
i show it to you .
the thian hock keng temple .
this is- you see this temple is a bit new .
the other temple is % uh two streets away .
but you really should walk there because that 's the nearest place .
and you can see % uh the oldest or well- one of the oldest temples in singapore .
% uh okay .
you 're welcome .
so entry to the temples or mosque , the hindu temples , the churches are all free of charge .
okay .
bye .
alright .
bye .
hi , good morning .
this is % uh tour guide one ,
my name is lynnette .
how can i-
% uh which area % uh do you want me to tell you ?
okay , alright .
and you have two days in singapore ?
alright .
okay , i- % uh singapore flyer is located on the southern part of singapore .
and % uh it will take you approximately about forty minutes to % uh do this % um % uh to give you panoramic view of the marina bay area as well as the % uh financial district area of singapore .
and if it 's on the fine day , you can even get to see % uh indonesian riau islands .
okay , so % uh the first picture that is actually the singapore flyer and % uh you , yah .
you can see you 'll be going onto the capsule .
% uh you can either take % uh the whole day , it 's fine .
% um unless it is raining , then otherwise % uh morning you get a different kind of view .
evening if you 're taking at night that 's also nice , because then you see the lights coming on % um in the southern part of singapore .
so either morning , it 's a bright morning .
% uh afternoon , it 's same .
at night if you want to see the lights then , yes .
then go on % uh the singapore flyer when you are % uh in the night time , okay .
this is the night scene out here .
and the first picture will be the day scene .
% uh a chew ?
% uh sorry , i do n't understand .
% oh a tube ?
% oh okay , yes it 's a capsule .
is , yah , it 's a glass capsule .
% um let me try and see- okay .
let me just show you how the capsules looks like .
okay , yah .
okay , now you can see here this picture .
% uh okay this people are actually inside this capsule .
so it can actually take in about % uh twenty people in one capsule , yah .
so it 's a glass , yah .
it 's glass % uh i will say , it looks like a bag .
yah .
okay , so this is the singapore flyer .
okay on normal days , we do n't provide % uh dining in the capsule .
this will be provided for special occasions like for example valentine 's day , yes we do % um % uh lunch or dinner that is provided inside this flyer .
yes , that 's the capsule .
a photo of the capsule .
% um otherwise if you just want to bring a bit of a snack , that 's actually fine as well .
yah .
okay , the singapore flyer will cost you twenty nine dollars and fifty cents % uh for one person for an adult .
the child will cost you twenty dollars and sixty five cent .
so that would be for two person will be twenty nine , % uh fifty times two for two adults .
yah , that 's right .
yah .
okay , for the universal studio , there are lots of attractions there .
we have seven zones that you can see .
okay , as you can see now on the screen , there are seven zones , alright .
there are rides like roller coaster if you 're looking to be very exciting .
roller coaster if you- madagascar and our latest ride would be the transformer .
the first picture over here .
okay , so this is something i think the whole family will enjoy .
% uh interesting ride .
okay , the price that you pay for admission to the universal studio includes % uh almost all the rides in universal studio .
alright ?
so , yes that is already included .
yes .
yes .
okay , the universal admission is sixty eight dollars for weekday .
seventy four dollars for weekends and holidays .
child will be fifty dollars % uh and fifty four for % uh public holidays and sundays - % uh weekends .
okay , closest hotel of course would be on sentosa island .
we have a few % uh resort that is located on the island .
for example % uh we have % um- okay , i 'm going to show you the hotels , okay ?
crockford hotel , % uh hotel michael , hardrock hotel , festive hotel , equarius and beach villas .
these are located just in the whole of resort world .
okay , so if you 're talking about very close , these are the hotels .
do you want me to provide you the price range ?
the price range for this hotel is in the range of about four hundred and above .
and above for one room .
but they are-
yes .
because these are resort hotels .
alright , there is a very % uh a hotel , small hotel that is quite near to % uh- on the mainland that is quite near to the % uh harbourfront where you will take the sentosa express to get on to the universal studio .
and the name of this hotel is harbourville .
okay .
okay , this one is in the region of % uh approximately % uh about a hundred and fifteen dollars .
yes , per night .
okay , this is the hotel .
it 's just a small hotel % uh no % uh restaurant facilities .
yes it 's about a hundred and twenty five dollars .
so if you are talking about very close and this hotel is possible to walk to the % uh harbourfront .
okay , now if you wan na a lit~ something a little bit better % uh i would say this hotel % uh just about % uh one stop away % uh from the harbourfront .
okay there is this hotel called m hotel .
okay it 's located in the financial district area .
okay .
so this would be % uh a nicer hotel , alright .
it is still convenient to get there .
but otherwise % uh most of the hotels are even in orchard road is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront .
% uh this would be in the region of two hundred over % uh dollars .
two hundred plus .
yes .
yes , correct .
per night means you check-in at three o'clock , two o'clock , three o'clock , and you will have to leave the hotel by twelve the next day .
okay , % uh eighty dollars .
do you mind staying in a backpackers ' hotel ?
okay , we do have % uh backpackers ' hotel in singapore .
okay .
okay there are quite a lot of % uh backpackers ' hotel in singapore .
now , % uh again depending on the % uh location that is-
yes , that you want to stay .
okay , i 'm giving you some list here of the hotels for backpackers ' .
they are all below a hundred dollars .
yah .
as close as possible ?
okay , then i would say that % uh there is a hotel called the inns over in chinatown .
i think that would be very close already % uh to the % uh harbourfront .
yes .
yes , that 's right .
okay , i 'm showing you now this % uh that inn over at temple street .
% uh it will be for % uh one person .
the rates .
yah .
yes , you are right in the heart of chinatown .
okay , because this hote~ % uh this % uh hotel is located in chinatown , so there are lots of dining options .
there are % um % uh restaurants , quite a lot of chinese restaurants including dimsum , just next street and all the lanes around the chinatown area .
but if you like to have % um street food , there is a street food call the chinatown complex .
and over there % um they serve % uh local food , and one meal let 's say if you are just having the % uh rice with three dishes , that will cost you approximately about five singapore dollars .
so with a drink it 's less than seven dollars , you could have a full meal .
yah .
tem~ okay , % uh this is very conveniently located .
% uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt .
the other ho~ % uh mrt would be tanjong pagar .
now tanjong pagar is actually the east-west line that you will take to go to the % um harbourfront , alright ?
% uh but if you are , sorry .
% uh , no you take the chinatown % uh station and go to the harbourfront .
% um but let say you are going to take % uh to the singapore flyer , then you will have to take from tanjong pagar and alight at the city hall and you take a walk about fifteen min~ seventeen minutes ' walk to the singapore flyer .
% uh on sentosa island , we do n't have subway .
% uh we have what we call the sentosa buses , that you can board .
% uh it 's all included in your ticket .
and you can also board the train on sentosa itself , we call it the sentosa express .
a visa coming in to singapore or a visa to sentosa ?
% uh which % uh visa are you talking about ?
okay for your % uh and you are % uh holding a philippine passport ?
okay , you wo n't require a visa to come to singapore .
and sentosa island is our , one of our island .
so it 's part of singapore .
so there 's no visa requirement .
% uh the flight tickets ?
okay , again i think it depends on which airline that you are taking .
% uh ya really very much depending of the airlines that you are taking .
or would you be able to-
more affordable airlines coming to singapore ?
% uh i would think % uh do you have budget airlines coming in ?
okay .
% uh you have the cebupacific airlines coming into singapore ?
yes , i think that would be a cheaper ticket coming in from % um singapore .
coming in to singapore .
% uh we have the same kind of temperature throughout the whole year .
% uh so there 's no % uh really specific time .
okay , maybe i 'll just give you a run down % um . i would say that it will be good to time your holidays % uh together with our major festivals here like february or january period will be chinese new year .
% uh it gives you that festive mood .
and % uh the hari raya sometime in % uh august , alright ?
deepavali -
yes , sometime in november .
and christmas time is also a very festive because , % uh we light up the whole street of orchard road .
so it gives you that very festive mood .
% um the rest of the hari raya , deepavali , we light up other streets in singapore .
so that gives you a very good a photography area for you to bring home % uh some memories of singapore .
yah .
yah .
yah , we do n't have major festival in the month of april .
yes .
okay , you will have to % uh- the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes to get to the northern part of singapore .
and you will alight at the mrt train station called the ang mo kio station .
and from there , you change a bus number one three eight , to get to the night safari .
so it will be better for you to allocate at least about one and a half hours from the hotel to the night safari park .
the park will be open from % uh seven thirty in the night time to twelve midnight .
yes .
the entrance fee will be thirty two dollars for an adult , and a child will be twenty one dollars .
yes , the tram ride is included % uh for the % uh price that i have quoted you .
okay , this is a wild park .
that means the animals are not tame , so % uh yes we do not % uh encourage anyone to feed the animals .
they are well-taken care of % uh by the zoo keepers .
% uh and they have % uh regular feeding time .
so we do n't want the animals to put on too much weight .
and they will be eating the wrong kind food if we give them the human food .
so they have special % uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them .
so strictly no feeding .
% um and also % uh we- for the night safari , because these animals , most of the animals are nocturnal creatures .
% uh so if you 're going to take photography % uh on the animals , then please switch off your % um flashlights .
% uh we do not % uh want to damage the eyes of these % uh nocturnal creatures , because being nocturnal creatures , they have very sharp % uh eyesight .
so we do n't want to damage % uh their eyes .
and that 's why we do n't want any flash photographies on the animals .
but if you want to take pictures of your friends or % uh just the backdrop , % uh without the animals , yes , then you can take % uh pictures with the flash .
% hm yes the highlight of course % eh some of the rarer animals that we do n't get to see so close % uh to us .
i would be- you see this tram ride ?
on the tram ride the malayan tapir comes very close to the tram , right ?
but please keep all your- any parts of your body to yourself .
do not stretch them out .
do not touch the animals because they are wild animals .
so this is something interesting as well as and of course on the tram ride , the deers will also come very close to the tram , alright .
so these are , i would say , interesting and highlight .
% um the other highlight would be the leopards that you can see up close % uh to you .
yah , % uh so you are actually just separated by the % um leopards .
yah , by a glass enclosure , okay ?
so you can see that on the screen now .
they 're so-close to the leopards and i think % uh it 's going to be a real highlight .
yah .
so you can see % uh the spots , alright ?
every spot of the leopard .
% uh so i think there are lot of nice % uh animals that you can see but , % uh i would say % uh personally for me , i think these are very exciting .
yah .
yes .
but % uh in order to see this leopard , you will have to walk % uh , remember just now the tram ride ?
okay , now when you are in the night safari , you get on the tram ride .
now in the middle of the tram ride , there is a stop so you can get off and do a short walk for about thirty minutes and you get to see the leopard up close and personal .
now , when you finish this walk , just come back to the main entrance and board another tram and that would bring you back to the main entrance .
now , again on the screen you can see there is fishing cat trail .
if you 're not too tired , you can do this trail and the trail would take you about twenty minutes .
and again the last trail it will be the forest giant trail , right .
so these are the three % uh trails % uh that you can do % um for the % uh tour over in the night safari .
okay , so it 's up to you whether you are too tired , you do n't feel like walking , on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals .
yes .
yes .
we have a night shows at the % um % uh night safari park .
we call it the creatures of the night show .
okay .
and % um it 's a different % uh from a circus show .
we 'll just show you some of the animals that will be coming up .
alright .
yes there you see the zoo keeper ?
alright bringing up not the % uh lions .
just the smaller animals % uh for you to see % uh a little bit closer , alright ?
% um so they will be just doing % um what they normally do like feeding , you know , how do they % uh take their food .
% um , yah .
so these are just things that they do .
otherwise this is the fire show .
% uh it is comes on every night , % um and they will be performing at the front- at the entrance of the night safari park .
now to see the creatures of the night show , normally it 's a long queue , % uh so you have to queue there , % uh you have to be % uh % um at the queuing up for this show a little bit early .
usually % uh more than half an hours in advance .
yes .
okay , their show is included .
so % uh if you want to see this show is they are all included in their admission ticket .
okay , the sh~
% uh no . % uh like i sa~ mention , all the animals in the night safari park are wild animals .
so only the zoo keepers allowed to touch them .
yes , because they are still wild animals .
the night safari starts at seven thirty a~
yes and it % uh-
twelve midnight , yes .
yes , you % uh- from seven thirty to twelve midnight , you definitely have a lot of time % uh to see everything in the night safari park .
but i do n't % uh- you do n't really need to stay until twelve p.m .
% uh not necessary , about three hours is already good enough .
for three hours is actually % uh enough % uh to see everything in the night safari park .
yes , you can leave at about ten thirty .
that is sufficient .
yes .
% uh ten thirty you can still take the public bus .
% uh one three eight back to the ang mo kio mrt train station and from there take % uh % um a train back to your hotel .
now , in singapore it 's pretty safe to travel around in the night .
but as usual , anywhere else in the world , you just avoid all the dark lanes % um and do not % uh carry too much cash with you , that 's all .
alright ?
okay , and we have our latest of addition , we have a baby giraffe that is just born .
in our night safari .
yah .
the giraffe is just a few months old .
yah .
% uh no . like i mention all our animals are wild animals .
so % uh it 's not- they are not tame at all .
alright ?
% uh sorry , what do you say ?
okay , do you- do you like to do a little bit of sport , extreme sport ?
like for example rock climbing ?
okay , we have % uh this rock climbing right in the heart of orchard road .
it 's called borderx .
yes , it 's rock climbing .
but it 's on a wall actually .
and you will be in a building .
borderx , alright .
and it 's right in the heart of the shopping belt .
yes , of course .
you need safety gear to climb up this wall .
okay , this is borderx .
okay , i am showing you the location it 's right in the heart of the orchard road .
the mrt train station will be somerset station .
okay , now let me just try and show you the photograph of this borderx .
yes , % uh a wall i would say .
% uh it 's about three-story tall .
again it depends on % uh how is your fitness level .
okay , so yes we do have % uh the trainers that will be % uh teaching you how to climb at this wall , alright ?
yah , so this is- yah , just going to show you .
okay .
% uh it should be in the region of thirty four % uh dollars .
yes .
are you quite fit ?
okay .
okay , yes .
now , i 'm showing you .
you see they are climbing up this wall .
okay , it 's thirty three dollars for the % uh- okay they just want to experience the climbing is twenty three for weekday and twenty eight % uh for weekend .
% uh yes and all the climbing gear , the safety gear , will all be provided .
yah .
so it 's open from monday to friday , % uh one to ten p.m .
saturday , sunday would be from eleven to ten p.m .
yah , it 's a thirty-metre vertical wall .
okay , i think you have to be a little bit fit for this .
okay .
so this is % uh something that 's exciting out here .
okay .
% uh well if you like food because a lot of the local people like to eat out here .
we have something % uh quite interesting .
it 's a kind of cookie and inside you have this % um pineapple % um paste in there , so it 's called pineapple tarts .
now , all the other races , the major races , we cook this or we bake this pineapple tart .
but all of us use a different recipe .
so you 'll be able to pick up this % uh from the bakery shop , they would have % uh the pineapple tarts .
otherwise if you enjoy meat , okay , like pork , % uh we have this barbecue pork slices , % uh so you can get them from this shop that specia~ or even you see them barbecuing meat , it 's marinated meat , so it has that tinge of sweetness in a meat and you can buy them back home , alright ?
some of them are vacuum packed as well , so it 's very easy for you to bring home % uh to your country .
yah .
% uh exotic , like how exotic ?
crocodile meat ?
turtle meat ?
yes we do have them here .
but of course you have to look specially for the restaurants .
% uh for turtle soup , you will have to go to some of this % uh non-air-conditioned coffee shops .
% uh where they serve this % uh herbal turtle soup .
well , they have so many interesting food out here .
so it 's really difficult to talk about the best % uh food .
% um so maybe can we be a little bit more specific ?
more unique to singapore ?
sorry , what did you like to have ?
heavy meal ?
heavy meal .
okay , so you are a foodie % uh ?
okay , maybe i will say % uh things food that we have here in singapore that you do n't readily get them in % uh philippines , right ?
maybe % uh fried hokkien noodles ?
you can get them in our food centre whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned .
so something that is easily available and i would say our majority of the local % uh favourite food .
fried hokkien noodle , okay .
so i 'm going to give you this , alright .
so % uh this is the- let me just show you .
yah , it 's actually with a bit of seafood like % uh kara mani , % um , okay .
okay , i 'm gon na show you some of the food now .
i think it 's a little bit small here .
so some-
yes , okay now , yah .
this is fried hokkien noodles , fried with prawn , kara mani and it 's yellow noodle and white noodle .
okay , so this is one i think you do n't get them back home .
okay , yah .
another yes , you can see , right ?
so it 's tasty .
yah .
and another dish that i would like to recommend you will be fried carrot cake .
this is a savoury food .
okay , it 's savoury .
it 's actually white radish .
you can see it 's actually white radish % um cooked with rice flour and that is the black version .
it 's has been cooked with black soya sauce , black sauce .
yah so it has a tinge of sweetness in there .
the white colour will be savoury .
so i do n't think you get this food back home .
so i like to just recommend you this two food , and of course a lot more % um % uh food that we have .
yah , so- yah , so it 's not the normal % uh orange carrot , % uh .
it 's actually white radish but we can call it the fried carrot cake .
so a lot more % uh % um food that i recommend , but like i said i think these are two , just two recipes that you may not get them at home .
yes .
% uh if you get from the % uh non-air-conditioned food centre , we call it hawker centre .
one plate of this would cost you only three dollars .
yah .
yes .
yes .
yah , you can have it for either breakfast , lunch or dinner .
okay , now singapore is not that big .
so everywhere you travel give yourself one hour is more than sufficient .
generally it should be a travelling time about half an hour .
okay , there are so many clubs % uh that are very good .
% uh again it depends on price range .
so i will give you % uh some of the clubs % uh that you can do in singapore .
okay .
but most important % uh they are very good clubs , right ?
okay , this is a zouk , alright it 's a very famous in singapore .
% um it 's just about half an hour % uh distance- % uh travelling time for you .
okay , and % uh the budget there it's- well can range from forty to hundred dollars .
it 's a very good dance club .
% um next door there is % uh the younger % uh , i would say the younger brother % uh of zouk , okay .
so there are two clubs there that you can do .
otherwise you can go to saint james powerstation .
okay , there are three clubs here ; zouk , phuture , and devil underground .
% uh you can also go to saint james powerstation .
there are quite a few clubs there as well .
so you want something more affordable , right ?
okay , this is an entertainment complex .
% um so there are quite a few clubs there % uh that you can % uh do .
yes , they do have .
so generally out there , okay , it 's a bit noisy- now , i 'm going to turn off this .
okay , now % uh there are entrance fee , so again it depends on which particular club you want to go to .
over at saint james it range from about forty dollars up to a hundred .
% uh then of course there more expensive club % uh world famous like % uh ku dé ta % uh that 's over at marina .
you 're familiar with this club ?
okay .
so maybe is something a little bit more affordable would be this club .
okay , let me give you this .
% uh are you talking about alcoholic or non-alcohol ?
alcoholic , okay .
for alcohol % uh we have a very good selection of wines , % uh from all over the world .
% um from shiraz , pinot noir .
okay , so really hard to pinpoint .
so we have so many % uh variety % uh of % uh wine here in singapore .
okay , cocktail-wise again a very good selection and in fact some of the clubs that you 're gon na visit , they would have their own concoction .
so really difficult .
but one of our local % uh cocktail , yes .
% uh that would be the singapore sling .
singapore gin sling , yes .
% uh it 's locally concocted .
% um so it 's a little mild kind of a cocktail drink pink in colour .
yah so that is something % uh that is local % um otherwise a very good selection of wine and like i said cocktail .
so it 's going to be too wide % uh to let you know like which % uh cocktail to recommend to you .
yah .
yes it 's a gin sling % uh that would be something that is locally concocted .
% uh , yah .
so the other club that i recommend you which is a little bit cheaper would be double o . okay , that is at queen street .
yah .
that will be a little bit % uh cheaper .
okay , unfortunately i do n't think the website is on .
okay , let see whether this- okay , yup , this is double o .
yah , so it will be a bit cheaper compared to zouk .
okay ?
alright .
yes , it 's a well-known club .
% uh a lot of % um tourist , % uh local likes to visit this club .
yah .
yah , this is like cheaper .
yah .
so you can do two clubs , alright .
one per night .
right .
okay , thank you for calling and % uh we hope to see you in singapore soon .
okay , see you then .
alright , bye .
hi , good morning .
this is tour guide number one
and this is lynnette .
warren ?
hi warren .
sure .
but % uh maybe you- can you give me a little bit of detail as to % uh what you would like % uh to do or see % uh out here or what are your interest .
and i would be able to recommend you the correct % uh things .
okay .
hot as in hotspots like % uh the dance clubs ?
so you are-
okay .
% uh but do you have special interest ?
okay sure .
alright .
i will start with % uh-
okay , i will start with let say % uh you 're talking about mountains .
well we do not have mountains in singapore .
% uh but what we have would be % uh bukit timah hill .
it 's not very difficult to climb .
so maybe- hill .
yah .
now bukit timah hill , i 'm just going to show you some images of the bukit timah hill .
okay , and this is just a hill .
% um it 's a nice walk up % uh in the morning you get to meet some of the local- quite a lot of the local like to climb this hill as well .
% um and it 's basically a very easy walk .
but of course if you want a more challenging walk up the hill then you can do the trail .
alright , but please do not get off % uh the normal walking trails .
yes and you get to see of course some of these % um bir~ butterflies % uh flora and fauna and you see all these people enjoying themselve climbing up the hill .
okay .
yes .
so it 's quite a nice walk .
you can do a relaxing % uh walk up or you can do % uh a more challenging up , you know , with all these steps up this hill .
and of course there are some monkeys that you will see along the way .
okay ?
so this is the bukit timah hill .
% um but mountain climbing , like i said we do n't have mountains here , this is only a hill .
so this is one of the % uh items that i would like to recommend you .
but of course again if you want something a little bit more challenging , we do have a weight- % uh sorry .
% uh cable ski in the % uh eastern part of singapore .
we have this % uh cable skiing out there .
as well as the beach % uh over on the eastern part of singapore .
% uh which place ?
the bukit timah hill ?
okay % uh , yup ?
right .
% uh okay .
but % uh you are going to stay % uh that means somewhere convenient for you to travel to all these places , right ?
okay , what i would like to recommend you to stay would be well , since you sounds a little bit like a more adventurer person , well you can % uh- do you mind staying in a backpackers ' hotel ?
yes , it 's not expensive .
you could get % uh a bed space % uh for as cheap as less than fifty dollars , singapore dollars .
% uh twenty five dollars , alright .
and they are quite a lot of this backpackers ' % uh hotel .
% uh and a few of them , in fact quite a number of them are located in very good co~ % uh locations .
you are just about five , ten minutes ' walk to the mrt , the subway .
okay .
% uh the beach ?
% uh east coast we do have beaches out there but % uh the sand there will not be like totally small white sand .
% uh no we do n't have that kind of sand out on the mainland .
% uh it 's just a place where the local people chill out , over the weekend .
% um do a sport of fishing .
% uh otherwise the better waters would be in our southern islands or on sentosa islands .
okay .
so we have-
talk a little bit .
% um and i like to- if we go back to just now % uh sports , right ?
i wanted to actually show you % uh the another sport that you can do , % uh the other water sports that you can do out here like cable skiing .
okay , and how about % uh something % uh-
wakeboarding , yes we have that as well .
okay , let me just % uh-
okay , that would be the eastern part of singapore .
okay .
% uh it 's around thirty over dollars .
yah .
do you- have you done that over in philippines ?
okay .
yes , we- yes .
eastern part , we have the east coast and changi beach .
% uh yes .
% uh but they are just simple beaches , you know .
yes .
and % uh then otherwise if you want % uh the nicer beach that would be at the % uh sentosa or to take a boat to the southern islands .
yes then you get % uh the nicer % uh beach out there .
okay .
% uh so i do n't have to rec~ do you want me to still recommend you some extreme sport here or we go straight to the historical places ?
sports first ?
okay now this one you are looking at is the % uh we have like the extreme swing .
% uh we also have the reverse bungee jump .
yah so and yes , i 'm scrolling down for you to see .
okay .
now , this is- % uh i do n't know whether- is it too small for you to see border x ?
okay .
now this is indoor % uh rock climbing and it 's right in the heart of % uh orchard .
okay .
the next sport will be % uh the cable ski and also wakeboarding , that 's in the east coast of singapore .
right .
next one extreme % uh swing and this is something quite new is ifly .
so you are defying gravity .
yah .
okay , this is on sentosa , alright .
so in the war- % uh sky diving % uh stimulator .
yah .
this is something interesting .
very interesting , alright .
okay , the price will be eighty nine dollars % uh for an adult .
yah but it 's % uh- well you ca n't get it in a lot of places , right ?
okay , so that 's the wakeboarding that you are talking about .
the next one- and i think you may find % uh- okay and we have also the extreme skate park over here in the east coast .
and so that gives you a lot of % uh excitement , interesting things to do .
this is a free admission , huh .
but of course you are to bring your own skate .
they provide you only with the % uh hardware .
yah , so you can- % oh that one ?
% uh that one only comes in the % uh f1 .
okay .
now , this is a street circuit .
okay , it 's % uh two hundred and forty eight dollars .
% uh sorry , what did you say ?
% oh okay .
yah this is the prices over here .
yah on your right-hand side , yes .
sixty-minute will be % uh six hundred over dollars .
% uh thirty minutes , three hundred and ninety six .
and if you just do the street circuit that 's two hundred and forty eight doll ~
okay .
yah just- okay , i think the- earlier on the % uh this ultimate skate park that is free .
% uh ifly , i think it 's still very reasonable considering that it 's very really exciting to do that .
% um and i think borderx is still very affordable as well .
okay , so these are things that you may want to consider to do % uh when you are in singapore .
so borderx it 's conveniently located , it 's in orchard road .
ski and % um the ski , cable ski , is on the east coast , so you could do that together with % uh sport of swimming in the east coast area or changi area .
now , % um ifly would be on sentosa island .
so , in case you 're going to sentosa island for a swim or to do the theme park , you could do that , % huh .
% uh wakeboarding it 's somewhere near the southern part of singapore ,
and % uh this one , yes you could combine again with sentosa , alright ?
now again the skate park , you could combine that with the % uh swim over at the east coast area and the cable ski .
alright ?
because they are located in the same location .
okay so we % uh so you have lots and lots of things excitement to do % um % uh for the extreme sport .
okay .
% ah okay .
right .
we have a few historical places % uh in singapore .
% um are you talking about ethnic historical places ?
okay of course % uh we have closer to % uh the orchard belt area we have chinatown .
this is chinatown .
okay .
yes .
% uh more activities , you see a lot more in chinatown % uh sometime during the january period .
% uh otherwise yes it 's a nice % uh % um a walk along some of the different % uh % uh different % uh lanes of chinatown .
% uh it's- so of course you see the traditional houses that 's flashed on your screen now .
you can get % uh very typical chinese food % uh in chinatown .
so do try % uh one of our very local chicken rice , % um fried hokkien noodles , fried carrot cake , and of course something that you can bring home would be the barbecue % uh meat slices .
and some of them comes in vacuum pack and it 's very easy for you to bring home .
% uh for the barbecue pork slices ?
okay , normal prices % uh excluding the chinese new year period , you can even get one piece % uh for fifty cents .
yes and it goes according to the weight .
so it can % uh cost you like thirteen dollars or twelve dollars for one kilogram .
yah , so you can buy a few pieces which you just want it or just to % uh for people to try one piece of % uh barbecue pork slices would be a quarter of our % uh laptop slice .
okay , so that 's chinatown .
% uh we do have a very interesting museum called the chinatown heritage centre .
okay .
now , % uh over in the chinatown heritage centre , you will see how people use to live in the past , alright .
i 'm just showing you some of their gallery pictures out here .
okay , so you see how people used to live in the past because % uh a lot of chinese , when they first came , a lot of them were illiterate so they could not speak or write english and neither not every one of the chinese could speak or write mandarin .
they would be speaking in their local dialect .
and since they were not skilled workers as well , they did n't have much money .
so they will just book or rent a bed space in all these chinatown houses .
so we can see how- % uh what kind of living conditions they were living in % um in the % uh chinatown heritage centre .
okay , so % uh this is the chinatown % uh heritage centre , yah .
just a few % uh gallery photos for you to see .
it 's located right in the heart of chinatown .
okay .
orch~ yah orchard , yes .
it is pretty near because % uh singapore is not so big .
% uh so everywhere % uh that you are going travel % uh approximately half an hour to one hour , it 's fine % uh if you 're taking the public % uh transportation .
okay ?
yes .
yes .
so the admission charges is ten dollars for an adult and six dollars for a child for a visit to the chinatown heritage centre .
so in chinatown you- % uh do n't just walk around the % um lanes but look into some of these % uh still traditional shops .
so they do have some interesting % uh things that they sell .
do also look out for % uh some chinese pastry shop % uh that you do n't see them in the modern confectionery .
so very typical % uh chinese pastry .
% uh and something that 's very interesting would be a round kind of cake called the mooncake .
% uh normally , yah .
so- yes , you can get that even if you come any time of the year .
okay , it 's % uh sweet .
% uh it 's a chinese pastry and of course we normally eat this food during the mooncake festival .
okay , at this year it will happen in the month of september .
yah , so this is the % uh mooncake festival .
and of course in this- during this festival , a lot of the people- okay i 'm gon na show the images of the mooncake festival .
okay , you can see this is mooncake .
alright ?
yah , % uh traditionally of course it should be brown and inside the mooncake it is filled up with lotus paste .
but now % uh with the modern % um % uh influences , you can even have % uh all sorts of filling from % uh durian , % uh to egg custard , chocolate , blueberry mooncake , alright .
and of course during this festival at it 's % uh eg~ % uh together with this festival , we also carry or rather the children would carry the lanterns .
so you can see some of these lanterns here .
the festival itself is just one day , yah .
so i think-
yes , it 's just for the one day festival .
but % uh prior to this festival , % uh people would be shopping % uh for mooncake to eat during the mooncake festival .
this is a chinese festival .
% uh there are quite a few legends associated with this festival .
can see the next picture here .
this is the lantern , the traditional lantern .
okay .
so this is % uh- yes you can still get to eat mooncake % uh anytime of the year .
% uh there 's a shop on % uh chinatown called sago % uh lane .
% uh the shop there sells mooncake throughout the whole year .
yes , chinatown i have showed you , right ?
at the % uh chinatown some of the pictures and what you can do over in chinatown .
the other historical ethnic area would be kampong glam .
okay .
now , kampong glam is traditionally where the indi~ % uh the malays , % uh the arabs use to live in the past % um and of course it gives you that % um malay influence .
as you can see from the houses here , they are a little bit different from the chinatown houses .
% uh there are carvings on the outside of the houses but % um you wo n't see a live- % uh creatures compared to the ones in chinatown .
yes you do see live creatures .
but the ones here would be mainly geometric or % um a plants , % uh flowers kind of design % uh on the facade of the building .
the highlight would be the southern mosque , okay .
and these are walking street in kampong glam .
and this- no , it 's % uh just a few street % uh and you can walk .
% uh you can easily finish kampong glam in two hours .
and since you 're there , do n't forget to try some malay food .
% uh for example some of the malay food would be % uh mee siam , mee rebus , nasi padang that means nasi is rice , rice with different dishes .
so you can try that .
% uh yes , generally the malay cuisine uses a lot more spices compared to the oth~
you like spicy food ?
okay .
and you can eat with your hands if you are trying malay food .
okay , so again some more scenes for you wa~ % uh to see % um over in the kampong glam area .
now , if you are going to kampong glam , % uh i would like to introduce you to this quite funky street call % um % uh haji lane .
okay .
% uh there are quite a few home-grown shops out there and they sell quite % uh funky , trendy kind of % uh-
yes , shirts and other interesting cafés out there as well .
% um yes i would not say that they are the branded ones .
but this is just some of the street scenes over in this lane , % huh .
okay , so- and of- 'cause the shops % uh you can find them in the shopping mall .
% oh it 's quite a colourful street out here .
okay , this is haji lane out here .
% uh well i would n't say the prices are like a dollar two dollars but % uh it is very different as you can see from the fashion here , alright .
you do n't get them from the normal % um % uh shopping competitors .
alright .
yes % um- so i would say it 's different .
okay , it 's trendy % uh and the most of this are own by young entrepreneurs .
% uh so i 'm just showing you some of the street scene in haji lane , alright ?
% uh yes .
% oh could i also % uh let you know we have one more ethnic area in singapore ?
okay .
we call this little india .
% uh no it 's not far , you- it 's also accessible .
it 's pretty near to kampong glam actually .
so if you do n't mind taking a walk % uh about twenty minutes at little india , okay .
okay , so again some of the scene here that you see in little india , very colourful .
and again if you like spicy food , you can try % um a size- a spicy food and try eating % uh chapatti , roti prata with your hands .
or even a malay dish call briyani % uh-
yes , it 's a coloured rice .
% uh % eh with chicken mutton , right .
and you can have that meal % uh famous in store in little india .
okay , and you were talking about universal studio ?
were you just mentioning about universal studio earlier on ?
okay .
pass there ?
okay .
okay , universal studio is a theme park .
it is % uh located in sentosa .
okay .
now , you can see this % uh rollercoaster ?
very exciting .
and some pictures of what you will see in universal studio .
okay .
and of course you see there are seven areas of universal studio .
reduce one day ?
sorry ?
you just want to spend one day in singapore ?
yes , you can .
you can finish all the rides in one day % uh for universal studio .
can .
possible .
it 's possible to finish it up all the rides in one day .
because that park will be open % uh from ten a.m . to nine p.m . so no problem .
you can finish all the rides .
yah .
the admission ?
to the universal studio ?
okay for % uh adult it 's sixty eight dollars % uh for % uh not- % uh weekday .
weekend will be seventy four dollars .
and the child will be fifty dollars and % um weekends would be fifty four dollars .
so if you 're thinking of doing the universal studio and since earlier on you indicated that you also like to try the ifly , % uh the ifly is on sentosa island .
yes , so you could do these two activities % uh in one day .
okay .
beach .
% uh beach .
% uh just now yes you also mentioned about beaches .
% uh we do have % uh i would say % uh better beaches out on sentosa island .
so you could easily spent two days , come back again the next day and do your beaches , the beach on sentosa island .
alright .
okay .
theme park % uh-
food .
% oh whether there is food available in the theme park ?
yah of course , hold on .
okay , delicacy .
chilli crab .
well , if for people who do n't mi~ % uh who like spicy food , because chilli crab is definitely spicy , okay .
so these are % uh chilli crabs , different recipes of chilli crab .
and % uh this is something that a lot of the locals like to eat .
so , yes i would say chilli crab will be something % hm very unique to singapore or the other version would be pepper crab .
yes , most of the seafood restaurant would be able to cook for you % uh pepper crab or % um % uh chili crabs .
yah .
they normally % uh the price will be charged according to the size and the weight , the weight of the crabs .
so while before you even order , % uh ask the % uh restaurant to give you the pricing first .
so generally one crab % uh a medium size crab would cost you about % um twenty dollars .
so if you have % uh just two of you , one crab is enough .
yah .
yah , these are- yes it not that tiny .
so yes you do get a fair bit of flesh .
% uh so yes the restaurant will tell you .
first you tell them , you know , to let you know the price first , % uh like how much roughly it 's going cost you if you order one , you order two because it 's quite hard to tell you the exact price because the price are priced according to weight of the crab for seafood .
so they price it accordingly .
this is % uh pepper crab .
again different % uh recipes of % uh pepper crab out here .
okay , so this is % uh something a lot of people like to eat .
% uh i believe you got durians in philippines ?
yah , okay .
so this- yes , we do like durians out here .
% uh okay , so now another kind of food that you may like to consider would be a-
okay .
so this is another food % uh that you may like to eat .
okay , this is oyster omelette .
oops !
you are hungry now , right ?
i 'm going to show you so many images of food .
yah .
it 's % uh egg % uh cooked with- or rather oyster cooked with egg .
so it 's actually % uh oyster omelette .
again you can eat them from % uh major- i mean from most of our food centre , air-condition , non air-condition or even restaurants , chinese restaurant they offer this % um % uh to % uh the guest .
yes .
yah so we have a lot of option in terms of food , huh .
so if you want to try all the food in singapore you probably have to stay a few years here .
okay , so we have % uh covered all the % uh sport % uh earlier on , right ?
okay , % um do you want to do a bit of kite flying over in singapore ?
okay we can do because the wind there is very good and a lot of % uh people do kite flying out there .
% uh some of them do this mechanical kite flying over at the % uh marina barrage .
right .
yes .
okay , so this is the place .
yes you can see all these kites out there .
okay yes they are driving kites .
and % uh well they are mechanical- some of them are mechanical % uh operated kind of kites .
it 's not the traditional % uh kite .
so this is done at the marina barrage .
% oh why do we go there to fly kites ?
okay , because % uh you get a very good sc~ % uh view , you can see the landmarks behind .
% uh these are the financial district of singapore and here you can see a little bit of the water here .
this is at the marina bay .
and the wind is usually very strong out there , so at any time of the day , you see people flying kites out there .
okay what you need to do is if you do n't have kites , you can buy it over there or you can bring your own kites there and fly your kite .
okay , so this is the kite flying % uh over at the marina barrage .
there you can see lots of people flying kites out there .
okay , so anytime % uh of % uh the day , alright ?
now , you see these three towers here ?
this is the marina bay sands resort .
if you just like to have a little bit % uh try your luck , i guess .
you can go into the casino .
% uh that 's located in the basement of the marina bay sands resort .
okay , if you want to have a good view of the southern part of singapore as well as the south china sea , you can a take ride up to the cantilever .
% uh on top of the marina bay sands resort , incurred a very good view up there .
yes , that will cost you twenty dollars .
up to go up there .
okay and there is a very good % uh dance club up there as well it 's world famous .
it 's a famous % uh club .
you have- that 's right .
or if you do n't want , you can just go there and just have a good view % um % uh of % uh a very good view .
three hundred sixty five view of % uh singapore .
yah well there 's a lot of things you wan na do that you can do , yah in singapore .
okay , so this is the kite flying over at the marina bay .
you can see there a big kites out there .
okay big-
yes , every month you will have to come for two days .
or you can also make it a longer trip .
% oh okay .
yah .
so , yah .
so these are some of all the- will you be interested in war museums ?
% uh we have a quite few war museums all over % uh various parts of singapore .
and-
% uh no , yes .
% uh like i mention , everywhere you go in singapore will probably take you only % uh half an hour to one hour if you are taking the public transport .
huh .
yes , and % uh some of the museums are not that big .
you probably can spend one hour , if you do n't have much time , % uh two hours would be most ideal for most of our museum .
so % uh there are war museums % um- if you are doing sentosa , you can come by this museum together because % uh it is just about two bus stop and you have to just walk up a hill call ' kit chandu .
% uh it 's called bukit chandu .
reflections at bukit chandu .
okay , just give me a minute .
sorry .
three museum ?
yes , there are few museums you can check .
so % uh i 'm giving you in terms of location .
so let say if you are doing the ifly , the % um universal studio on sentosa island then you could do this museum because they are in the % uh southern part of singapore .
% uh , you know , because you also mention that you do n't want to spend too much time travelling .
so they are in like basically the same location , so you could this museum .
it 's a good museum and there is a show inside the museum .
% uh but basically this museum % uh shows you % uh the last battle of singapore at the southern part of singapore .
and % uh last % uh- that area is the defended by the % uh malay regiment of singapore .
so that was a very fierce battle that was fought in the southern part of singapore .
so at this particular building , % um % uh and around the hill area , that was the last battle just before singapore surrender .
alright .
so , yes .
again if you are going to sentosa , we have another museum there .
% uh it 's called fort siloso .
yes , it 's on sentosa .
so again , you know , you easily can spend a number of days just on sentosa .
so i 'm going to show you some images of fort siloso .
% uh this one will be the wax % uh figure showing you the surrender of singa~ % uh of the japanese to the allied forces in nineteen forty five .
and this one here will be the surrender of the british to the japanese in nineteen forty three , alright ?
so it shows you the war % um that happened % uh on in sentosa , alright .
okay % uh- okay , this one the entrance is ten dollar .
yah .
% uh that is also ten dollars .
yes .
okay , but again it depends on what you want to see .
if you just want to see the last battle , or do you want to see like more of the % uh artefacts that were used % uh- alright , there 's one here .
this is on % uh fort siloso .
okay .
yes , so i 'm just showing you images of the fort siloso .
this museum it 's % uh some parts of it are open air .
% uh whereas the other one would be a indoor kind of a museum .
so we are talking about different % uh focus of war % uh for this % uh two museum .
and of course there are lot more other museums .
so i just % uh recommend you this two % uh for the time being .
so you have been doing a lot of % uh- well i have recommended you a lot of exciting things to do .
do you want to tone down things a little bit ?
right .
ifly ?
yah .
% uh yes , you could do all these yes in two to three days .
% um because besides the attraction that we talk about , there are other attractions like the other parks % uh images % uh there 's a museum also , another museum showcasing the history of singapore .
% uh so again , yes easily two to three days .
so like i said you just have to shortlist , you know .
and what are the things that you want to do .
the- the what-
the hotel , okay .
so we were talking that you do n't mind % uh backpackers ' hotel , right ?
okay , we have a backpackers ' hotel .
quite a lot of them actually .
okay .
% oh no problem .
no prob~ okay .
okay , yes .
i 'm listing for you quite a lot of the backpacker hotel .
% uh okay all these are all in the range of twenty over dollars to fifty dollars % uh per night .
okay , all these hotels that you are seeing now on the screen .
% um and quite a lot of them are in pretty good location .
near the beach backpackers ' hotel .
not that near the beach , alright .
walk to the beach .
then you will be on the eastern side of singapore .
no , i mean but eastern part of singapore .
so we don't-
you still ca n't walk to the beach , % uh even though we have some backpackers ' hotel in the east .
% uh would i be able to recommend you this hotel call sleepy sam ?
sleepy sam out here .
okay , it has very good review and it 's right in the heart of the heritage area of kampong glam .

okay , another one will be betel nut .
no , they are- like i mention it 's between twenty over dollars % uh to fifty dollars .
okay .

% uh no . % uh the club on sentosa % uh no really like % uh dance club on sentosa .
we have just drinking places .
yah , so there are drinking places by the beach , % uh that serve wine , cocktail , soft drinks .
% uh but the bands you will have to go back to mainland .
so what kind of music do you like ?
% um hip-hop , local bands ?
hip-hop .
just acoustic .
home-grown ?
okay , we have % uh club that does % uh local bands .
it 's called home .
no , it 's not so expensive .
okay .
well , the location- i do n't think i have the pictures for you to see .
% uh but this is % uh located % um just at % uh boat quay area .
the southern part of singapore .
so there are quite a few % uh bars and clubs % uh located % uh around the clarke quay area .
and the actua~ % uh the street name will be called the riverwalk .
okay , so if you are talking about hip-hop , then it will be butter factory .
okay , this is % uh hip-hop sorry ?
% oh no , you do n't need the tour guide for your % uh clubbing , right ?
just grab a few friends and you 're done .
or well , there are always % uh like-minded people over in all these clubs .
so this is % uh hip-hop and r and b .
yah .
so again they are all located in very centralised % uh area % uh in singapore .
okay , dress code % uh just club fashion .
clubbing there .
wow , a lot of things that you have to do here .
okay , just to tone down things a little bit .
% uh you can do this % uh very % uh relaxing cruise on the singapore river .
% uh just an half an hour ride .
% uh that would be fifteen dollars .
% uh no . no , i think your most expensive cost that you 'll be spending here will probably be your clubbing , i think , right ?
% oh dear .
okay , so this is the- just to tone down things a little bit .
% uh you can just take a river cruise .
% uh that would cost you fifteen dollars , along the % uh , okay , along the singapore river .
okay .
okay , just give me a minute .
% uh yes , you can take anytime of the day , we have this cruise .
just about half an hour ride on the % uh singapore river .
% uh yes , the price is the same but of course we are looking at % uh different scenery .
okay , you are just looking at different scenery .
% uh in the night time , % uh you get to see the lights and there 's a commentary on the cruise itself .
% uh like i said , you know , since you are going to do so much exciting things in singapore so we just tone down things a little bit .
if you still have the time % uh and energy , then you just go for a river cruise on the singapore river .
okay , yes .
okay , you 'll be seeing this % uh and this is the boat .
let me show you the boat .
yah , % uh it 's used to ferry goods in the past , % uh this kind of boat .
alright .
i do n't know whether you see this boat out there ?
and the buildings behind is actually is boat quay .
so if you are taking in the daytime , this cruise , then of course it 's a totally different kind of scenery .
the night cruise when all the lights comes on and again a different view of % uh singapore on the river itself .
okay ?
yah , so you have to come back a few times % huh , not just one , okay .
yah .
yes .
otherwise you ca n't finish everything that you want to do here .
welcome .
alright , so we hope to see you in singapore soon .
alright .
welco~ okay , same to you .
bye .
hello ?
could you spell your name again please ?
% oh arlyn , i see .
i am tour guide number two and my name is jeanne .
good morning arlyn .
hi arlyn .
how can i help you ?
% uh can i have your dates again please ?
okay in may .
and- so the dates are flexible you are not % uh- you have n't book anything yet ?
what are your interests ?
yes singapore is a hub for the rest of southeast asia % uh we have also very good connections by air and by sea .
but what particularly are- is your husband and you- % uh what do you normally do when you 're relaxing ?
a theme park , okay .
how old is your daughter ?
% oh she 's only four years old , okay .
% uh but at four years old % uh- some of the rides she may not be able to take .
you can visit the theme parks but % uh like the roller coaster rides and all that they may have restrictions on % uh on the height or the age of children for some of the rides because of her size .
you can bring her to the gardens % uh you can bring her to the zoo and also the bird park and the night safari .
% uh night safari .
can i % uh show you about the % uh singapore wildlife reserves that runs all three parks ?
just give me a moment .
so what you 're seeing is an aviary where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park .
and this the night safari tram ride which you can take % uh if you are too tired to walk or you can walk as well as you know take the ride .
you can do both if you have time .
if- % uh you can go in a little bit earlier but they wo n't let you ride inside to take the tram ride until after the sun goes down which is seven o'clock .
% uh those are tapirs that you see along the ride .
now this is the day zoo can you see elephants of asia ?
so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo which is next to the night safari .
so you should visit .
% uh if she likes the zoo very much because they have a children 's % uh playground area in there and she can take a little % uh like a train around the zoo % uh in the children 's playground .
she can also % uh see- you know pet the little animals , the small ones that are like rabbits and % uh pygmy horses , you know .
the very small and tame animals she can % uh do rides and she can handle them and the shows are directed at children .
yes , there are % uh times where you can ride the elephants , or the horses in the zoo .
% uh at night we have a tribal show % uh at the night safari where they recreate what the tribes do in borneo .
yes that 's right , they- because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves .
so it is one- under one umbrella organisation and that means you can buy a package ticket with a built-in discount .
and-
yes for all of them .
normally you have a month to use up the ticket but- so if you 're staying just two or three days you would definitely use it up .
okay , river safari is new .
and it takes you from one part of the zoo to another part and you 're lucky because it has just opened .
so of course you 're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now but it 's a simulation .
so here you go you can see % uh crocodiles - baby crocodile here .
yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits and on the boat ride the guide will show you % um you know the skin the moult of the % uh snakes .
things that you do n't normally see when you % uh just visit a zoo but when you take the ride you can see exhibits that they have collected .
you know when the animals die they have these specimens .
now the panda that you just saw they have not yet come .
but they are coming , okay so we are just % uh waiting for them arrive .
yes this % uh night- % uh the river safari is % uh a new trail .
they had a river ride all along but now they have enhanced it .
so you see at the bottom there the different zones ?
so they are trying to re-create these zones within the river safari .
% uh yes it is .
% uh it 's % uh forty hectares if i remember correctly , the riv~ the whole zoo .
yah .
% uh they actually have ninety hectares in total but they have n't develop the whole area .
so % uh the night safari % uh- shall i show you pictures of that ?
night safari gives you % uh very magical feel because here we have nocturnal animals and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal .
so we have settle lighting % uh at where they feed and then they will put food at these places .
it 's actually token feeding .
it 's to encourage the animals to be in the light so you can see .
and some like these tapirs they are tame enough for them to roam around along the trails .
so sometimes they stop and % uh % uh let- they have to stop to let the tapirs have right of way .
you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park but not at the night safari % uh at the animals .
you can take when they are doing the show you can take cozying in the open areas but not at the animals because we won't- do n't want to spook them .
that 's the only thing .
okay .
% uh do you want to see the zoo ?
did i show you the zoo ?
i show you the zoo first and then i give you the package ticket , okay ?
that 's the naked mole rat that 's why they called it the nudist colony .
you 're not going to-
you wo n't see naked people there do n't worry .
okay .
and here you see .
if you go early enough you can breakfast with wildlife .
are you getting it on your screen ?
the three animals at the back that look like hairy monkeys they are orang-utans .
that you normally have to go into the forest to see % uh but here some of them are actually bred in our zoo and they are trained so they come out and you can take a photograph with them even your daughter .
that would make a good souvenir photograph , yah .
and we have-
% uh no because % uh where you 're eating is separate from where they are and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating .
so they do n't come and help themselves to your food .
you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area and you 're looking at i think some lemurs at the back there will be butterflies fluttering , birds flying around it 's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest .
% uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there are all tamed and quite friendly .
including the two-toed sloth .
you know the very slow moving sloth that % uh it 's up the tree .
it 's very hard to see in the jungle , you can see it here .
and we have the sea lions that do a show , you can get your daughter to take part in the show .
are you there ?
yah .
you can volunteer % uh your daughter when they asked for volunteers at the bird park show and also at the % uh day zoo tour and if they selected then she 'll be the star of the show .
yes , that would be fun is n't it ?
especially yes , having your wedding anniversary .
so shall i show you- you were asking about ticketing , right ?
% uh , % oh just hold on a minute .
% oh i think it's- wait .
okay .
can you see the park hoppers ' specials ?
so three in one because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars .
and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it 's forty eight .
there is a saving because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price .
and you see you can use it within a month , within thirty days .
s~ the only thing is it doesn't- % uh % oh it includes the night safari tram ride but % uh not the tram ride within the day zoo .
so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride .
you can also walk % uh after you do your tram ride if you have time because then you can see % uh on the night safari different set of animals and the day zoo she can get closer up to all the animals .
yah .
yes , that 's right you see thirty days to use it up .
so you could even take one at a time .
but if you go to the night safari and the zoo % uh at the same time because they are next to each other you save on the fare and the time , you save time travelling .
you can visit the zoo starting from morning 'till evening or you can visit it in the afternoon 'till about six o'clock and then just walk across to the night safari .
okay .
% uh do you want to see pictures of the tram ride ?
you 're okay % huh .
alright .
cultural shows % uh- we have activities- if you 're thinking of your daughter we have activities within our museums targeted at children .
% uh but % uh culturals shows , no we have more the adult theme shows .
okay .
you 're talking about normal cultural shows % uh nothing to do with the zoo , right ?
okay .
% uh what i 'm showing you is actually a show that just shown % uh in a resort .
but if you are talking about chinese , malay , indian dance we used to include it on a city tour but % uh it 's not really % uh a show that you just go on and see you know % um like in many other places .
but when you 're here , if there are shows at our esplanade which i will show you later you might want to book them .
just give me a minute to get you the resort , the sentosa resort .
% uh the mar~ we have a re~ big resort on sentosa island .
okay .
what you can see- i do n't call it cultural actually it 's % uh got % uh pyrotechnics .
so if you like the beach and you go to sentosa you can see this show .
so it 's not the traditional cultural show you know what i mean ?
but your daughter might enjoy this it 's % uh full of colour , you can see there .
yes music .
% uh before that % uh the people will be encouraging you to sing along with them .
so this is more high-tech it 's what i think people like today .
so you go there in the evening , can you see the times here at seven-
and eight forty .
and because it 's popular they have an additional show on saturdays and public holidays usually there 's an additional show .
yes .
% uh if you go to sentosa island you go to the beach this is just % uh along the beach .
% uh i think premium seats are more in the centre and let me scroll down i think these are premium seats .
perhaps padded , there you are .
so you pay for the cushioning and you get a very good view .
but i think here you 'll get a better view .
you are right in the centre so that you can see it very well .
% uh there 's another show and it 's called the voyage de la vie it is at the sentosa resorts .
yes , just a moment .
so i know i 'm not answering your question directly about cultural shows
these are more fun things that % uh singaporeans also go to enjoy .
and i have seen this show myself .
% uh there 's a lot of acrobatics , % uh very spectacular .
% uh the cast is international .
yah .
so there you see it 's % uh our longest running show .
% oh i ca n't remember exactly .
i do n't know if this they tell it here but i saw it months ago , it 's ninety minutes .
it 's a circus % uh theatre production and- % oh i did n't even know it 's created in singapore through a celebration of song and dance .
it 's full of activity so one and a half of hours .
the story is simple about a young man on a journey but it is more- you see the dancing , you see the acrobatics .
yes every day % uh i think .
% uh let me see , they must have a day off probably .
okay .
they are taking from wednesday to friday from october the first , yes .
so that means i think monday and tuesday is their day off .
i- for sure the acrobats they need a break so wednesday and friday at eight thirty but saturday and sunday they have a matinee show .
% uh because it 's so popular they want to have a earlier show so some people take the show and then they % uh do the songs of the sea after that .
and i think-
i think it 's their annually from twelve to twenty third of september .
yah .
frankly you do n't need to have the hundred and eighty eight dollar tickets .
% uh i think hundred and eight is good enough already .
they- yes i think they do , let me see .
they do n't have child rates though .
so kids have to pay the same rate as adults .
the theatre is n't very large , i do n't know the actual capacity but i was inside and i think it 's not like so huge that if you pay hundred and eight dollars you ca n't see very well .
some people do n't have the performers right you know too near them , it could be scary .
so % uh hundred and eight dollars would be fine .
yes .
% uh high-end shops we have down at orchard road which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels .
% uh then we have also shopping malls % uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront .
vivocity is newer and it has got % uh a very huge singaporean following on % uh weekends .
i 'm showing you orchard road on the screen first .
so you can see we 've got gucci there .
it's- you can get all the good brands there but there are also shops that sell things like g two thousand do you know it ?
a mid-price range .
but the concentration of branded shops would be at orchard road and also at marina bay sands where that we have a casino .
so what sort of shopping are you looking for ?
okay if- since you 're celebrating your wedding anniversary your husband might want to buy you , you know something very grand .
do you see this picture here ?
% uh so this is marina bay sands it 's the other resort in singapore and it 's down by the bay .
it 's not very far from sentosa in fact .
can you see the building ?
so right on top is the swimming pool but % uh-
yes .
yes .
% uh actually infinity pools scare me a little bit i think i 'm going to swim right out to see .
okay , we have here- % uh let me go to the shopping alright .
we have a list of shops here .
% oh you have to search for the store , let me see .
% um i 'd like to go to an old store that has kept up with the times and modernised and it 's called c k tang .
tangs is the short form , t a n g and it 's at vivocity just in front of sentosa island .
% uh here you see- this is a list of the shops you get at marina bay sands % uh or rather it 's categorised by what you want .
so what is your preference , i can select for you .
jewellery .
okay these are the stores we have , bulgari % uh cartier all the branded % uh-
% uh from the store window .
citigems is- i think it 's local , tio tianpo also .
so you should be able to get prices that are not so % um high-end over there .
so can you see citigems on your screen ?
so this is a huge shopping area called the shoppes at marina bay sands , can you see on the right hand side of your screen ?
so this if you want to spare your husband you go to citigems .
if you want to break his bank you go to some of the other store .
yes .
% uh anything else you want to see by way of shops ?
okay .
you have n't selected your hotel % huh , have you ?
okay , but % uh-
we have got marina bay sands still on the screen so we 'll have to wait for it first and then we search for your hotel .
okay .
i want to suggest to you this hotel in chinatown .
it is quite romantic .
it is a boutique hotel - oops .
you see the building was built in nineteen twenty nine hence the name of the hotel but it was bought over by a young man who likes to % uh restore old buildings .
and so it 's a protected building and it 's been converted into hotel rooms .
and here you see the facade of the hotel .
it 's got bay windows .
the rooms are very interesting % uh that he even has a suite on the % uh top floor .
so you do n't have dates you 're just talking about may is it ?
okay .
may .
% uh we can check , shall we start ?
what day in may are you thinking of ?
not a- okay .
wednesday the ninth ?
because may day would be on the first .
% uh if they have higher rates on that ti~ at that time they might be charging a bit more .
yah .
room , so are you taking one room or two rooms ?
one room is enough , % huh ?
% uh one room .
because your daughter is only four or we can put it as two guests but you can ask for an extra bed when you are there .
% oh it 's very safe .
it 's in the heart of chinatown .
% oh no it's- % uh you saw the picture , it 's been totally refurbished .
and totally renovated .
and i have in fact visited it when % uh it was % uh completed and they have % uh even a room where you can have % uh a bath looking out into the sky .
% uh i did- we did step into the bathroom and check out because you know around there are skyscrapers all the hotel % uh buildings and % uh office buildings but they have a lot of greenery around and so that it shades off- it shades you off from the view of anybody nearby .
superior room is called the terrace suite , can you see the price ?
yes .
yes .
it 's quite fun actually if you are not the shy type .
you are ?
it is % uh quite okay you should actually check it out and have a look .
it 's just that you know % uh this is quite nice because it 's right at the top of the hotel , the hotel has just about three storeys .
% uh you can also take % uh junior suite then .
okay .
yes .
here we go .
junior suite , i 'm trying to get a picture of it for you .
so junior suite , that was the next category to the terrace .
so can you see everything is new in there ?
% uh you should have enough .
% uh what was the price of % uh your show it 's a hundred and eight dollars , right ?
but the- yes % uh . so in fact you have- we have tickets at forty eight dollars if i remember correctly .
% uh the junior suite is two hundred plus like two hundred and fourteen dollars .
yah .
so you stay in two days , is that right ?
seven hundred over dollars , yah .
you have to go down on your % uh expectations for the show .
you need to downgrade on your show .
okay .
this room is a hundred and ninety six dollars deluxe room .
yes that would be under two hundred dollars .
% uh superior double , maybe the fittings i 'm not sure .
you want to see superior double ?
yes it 's the fittings , it 's a little bit simpler .
yes , % uh very nice , very pretty .
and you may notice that deluxe and the suites have the same decor .
and you have your own wash basin right next to you .
so- maybe you downgrade on your show price tickets .
so your rooms % uh-
the zoo price was about sixty dollars , right ?
% uh somewhere around that , just a minute .
okay .
do you want to see the sup~ you do n't want the superior double , % huh ?
okay .
no . s~ okay that 's the only picture we have of the room .
yah .
so we close this .
so this is the room you want ?
yes it 's two hundred and fourteen dollars so four hundred and twenty eight dollars .
% uh do you want to see the show at forty eight dollars or fifty eight dollars ?
safari price was about sixty - let me see i forget the price .
package price for the three in one for the night safari zoo and the bird park , right .
the wildlife reserves .
if you are staying two whole nights , one night for the night safari and one night for the show .
so let 's see the rates .
% uh the package price is what you want , right ?
okay .
so yah , it 's about sixty dollars .
it 's fifty eight dollars for the three of you .
% uh for one of you .
so let 's take it at sixty so it 's about a hundred and eighty dollars for your-
% oh yes .
thirty eight dollars so it 's only a hundred and sixty dollars .
so you have spent % uh four hundred - almost five hundred dollars .
yes , % uh- but not on a hundred and eight because you want to eat right ?
you want to unless you have a separate budget for that .
% uh can you downgrade to the fifty eight dollar ticket for the show ?
no it 's not too far because as i said the hall is n't very big and the performers are right in front of you , you know .
it is % uh- you get a good view .
yah fifty eight dollars is one of the lower price range well take it at a hundred and eighty dollars for the three of you .
of course there 's no child ticket .
so you have seven hundred and sixty eight dollars spent more or less now .
% hm it will not % uh break the bank .
% uh maybe you shall pay % uh twenty dollars or twenty five dollars for the ticket , % uh it 's called the ez-link card for- you know when you travel by train and by bus .
you use this card to pay for your fare so you do n't have to use any money .
that 's right .
and then before you leave any balance value you can get a refund .
% uh at the airport you pay twelve dollars .
here you go , can you see ?
and-
yah .
and you would have to top up some money so- or maybe you allow thirty dollars for it just to be safe .
so you do n't have-
yes .
so you do n't have to go to a seven eleven store to top up the value if you run out .
then you 'll get your change before you leave your airport you go to the counter and get a refund .
% uh it depends on how far you are going and the places you 're going to except for the zoo and % uh bird park is the further .
it 's just a little over two dollars for the both of you .
% uh two dollars each , yah .
so % um-
you need to get three % uh- you need to get three % uh to to use for your daughter as well and then you get your refund before you leave .
so i have provided like ninety dollars for the three of you and you know you have some extra spare .
that brings you to- food places .
you stay at this hotel in chinatown .
go to the maxwell food centre that 's the cheapest place for food and the best value because you get authentic chinese food .
do you like chinese food ?
and this place is a very old market that also has been restored .
and the good thing is you can see food that is being sold .
you can see- in other words are you getting chicken or duck or fish .
and the people there office workers when you go on a week day % uh they will be happy to explain to you what they 're eating if you need help .
so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something a dollar juice % uh if you like .
soya bean , a dollar as a dessert , five dollars for her .
and for your husband and yourself maybe seven or eight dollars each .
yes very good % uh i eat there quite often .
% uh there is a chicken rice store - % uh there are i think two stores there , you just look for the one with the longest queue .
it 's you know- % uh she serves the best , you know .
it is- she 's very generous with the ingredients chicken and the rice .
% uh and if you- do you know porridge , rice porridge ?
% uh so that too .
so do n't order like five dollars just order the minimum and you 'll get an idea of it .
so the taste is also the best and the guidebooks for food have written up about her .
% uh there is what we called % uh teochew porridge .
so it is rice porridge and there are sort of variety of dishes like steam fish , fried fish % uh salted egg , vegetables - different vegetables cooked in different ways , tofu .
so you pick what you want and you eat it .
% uh so it depends on what you pick fish , % uh a whole fish of course is more expensive if you are just taking a slice is less and if your taking vegetables usually it 's a dollar or seventy cents a little plate .
so because it 's so cheap you can take a variety and the three of you can share .
yes very close you can walk there .
and you can even eat there every day you will not run out of stalls okay because have so many stalls there % uh i think over a hundred .
yes .
% uh there is- there are also indian stalls selling something like % uh % uh fried pancake .
you know prata , it is a dough that is fried and we take it with chicken curry or fish curry or mutton curry .
% uh that- there probably is but i can not recall for sure .
usually- i think yes there is a thai there is what she call herself japanese but you know it 's the cheaper type of japanese food there .
so it 's at the lower end .
maybe you pay five dollars for rice and % um % uh piece of meat a sizeable piece of meat on your rice .
and for thai food you will get your usual green mango , you know .
% uh the sour and sweet mango % uh and the pad thai , you know pad thai ?
the noodles , it 's very nice , it 's a very special thai dish .
and % uh even if you do n't go to this market % uh you can walk along the streets in chinatown and you will be able to find thai food , you 'll be able to find % um malay food % uh even our muslim restaurant .
so if you want to try different cuisines just outside your hotel you can find .
we also have a food street there , it 's called smith street .
you can take this down s m i t h street it 's the food street of singapore .
about more or less the same .
yes i go there when i 'm in chinatown i will always eat in chinatown .
but because my place is quite near to chinatown % uh you know i 've been- i eat quite often , maxwell market especially .
so can you see the pictures here ?
% uh okay this one shows the food .
okay just wait a while for it to load the picture .
you see at night the road is closed off to traffic and the stalls are put out and the stall holders man their cooking just next to the tables
yes , but this is for food .
and in chinatown the night market is also a day market .
so on the next road to this is where they sell things that you can buy like souvenirs .
this is smith street where you eat .
% uh if you walk and you stop and look at shops maybe ten minutes otherwise i- if you walk fast i think five minutes you can get there .
so you can get your souvenirs , cheap souvenirs % uh if you need to buy like for twenty people or thirty people you do n't want to spend a fortune .
% uh you can get things for one or two dollars % um-
yes , but % uh there would be things like you know chopsticks with % uh-
% uh it 's actually along the street side .
i do n't think they have a website .
it is % uh a little stalls where they sell % uh souvenirs like during the new year they sell we~ decorations for chinese new year .
this would be the closest to a bazaar .
you want- okay you want pictures of the shops let me see if i can get it for you ?
i 've been doing it for more than twenty years .
yes .
when i first did chinatown we had a street side fortune tellers but they are gone now .
% uh they are- you know that we spruced up chinatown that 's why if you 're worried about anything all the buildings are very clean , they have been conserved so they look % uh new but in fact they are from the eighteen hundreds .
yah .
can you see the picture of the stalls there ?
so here you see the lanterns decorating the street side for the lunar new year which is around february .
and then it 's quite crowded .
but at this time that you % uh you can also buy things along chinatown but you wo n't have to jostle with people it will be more comfortable for you .
% uh yes .
so here you can see , you can get your post cards .
you-
can you see a little chinese costumes , if i 'm not mistaken for your % uh daughter ?
no . no they are not expensive at all .
in fact some of them when they hang big signs outside their stalls % uh usually i do n't bargain because they are already telling you that this is a bargain .
yes you can get one for yourself and for your daughter as well .
a lot of tourists do that because they can wear their souvenir
okay .
% uh here you can see some % uh i do n't know if you 're interested in these , chinese % uh artefacts .
the little dragon there , you can use it to decorate your home .
% oh you do , okay .
very colour~ ye~ yes .
% uh they- during the chinese new year period before the chinese new year we get a lot of shop selling these decorations .
% uh yes .
this- the brown things ?
if i 'm not mistaken this is a dried gourd , g o u r d. it is a fruit like a melon that is dried up and when it 's dried it hardens and they dig out the centre .
and when it 's thoroughly dried it is a container , it 's waterproof .
so in in china they are used to keep chinese medicines even liquidised medicines inside these containers .
so when you give this away to somebody it is % uh a symbol of wishing him good health and longevity .
so new year you can get them- % uh usually you 'll give them to the older people .
it 's symbolic , nobody would put medicine in them now we just buy it for fun .
no it 's available all the time .
% uh here we have something fancy , we have the fans .
okay these are the chops- these are the fans .
% uh you might want to get one just to fan yourself when you 're walking around and that if you take care of it , it will last .
can you see it 's a dollar ?
paper .
% uh i think it 's printed .
you can get th~ % uh there is a calligrapher there in chinatown who will draw your- write out your name in chinese % uh then you 'll have to pay him accordingly .
% uh he will look at your name and he will get the phonetic translation into chinese and try and give you a nice meaning and then he would % uh give you a scroll with your name on it .
you can hang that in your house too .
maybe about ten dollars only i think .
you can bar~ that man is nice you can bargain with him .
he did it for school kids at % uh you know a few dollars just to amuse them .
can you see at the back of the picture here these squares that are tilt over ?
% uh that is paper cut outs in red paper .
i have some myself .
% uh this is a skill from the chinese % uh are very good at .
they fold paper up and then they cut it .
and after they finish cutting they open up the paper and you 've got this wonderful design % uh-
% uh usually abstract but not abstract in the sense that you can make out what it is , you know .
yah .
% oh no i ca n't make them i 'm so- i only buy such things .
okay these are the chopsticks
% uh if i 'm not mistaken i once saw a chopsticks for children where they attached the two chopsticks together so she can not lose the chopstick while she 's eating .
and she can not drop it on the floor , maybe you 'll get one for your daughter .
yes but the adults always buy this to train themselves .
% oh you do n't know how to use chopsticks .
okay .
okay , you 're talking about the fish ?
yes , you see the chinatown hawkers ?
that street i told about where you saw the pictures of all the stalls along the road decorated with the lanterns ?
you can get this dish .
% uh it 's a special fish song he that the chinese like .
they believe that it can cure them of % um sickness and things like that .
and here it 's cooked .
you can see the dish it 's around fifteen dollars .
and you can tell them not to put chili if you do n't want chili because here they cook it specially for you .
yah , little- here the chili looks like a garnishing so i think it should be okay .
yah .
okay .
% uh yes i 'd like to eat that but i have to be very careful with the bones % uh to you know .
usually we do n't eat when we- we do n't talk when we 're eating this so we can concentrate .
you will have to pick up the bones for your daughter .
yah the way- because it 's near the heat to you 'll scales you know that what 's inside the mouth here and there but it 's very yummy to eat .
it 's where you eat and you chat and you use your fingers .
okay .
you can cross the street in chinatown safely .
can you see this bridge ?
it 's a very wide bridge and when you cross over we have a shopping centre and shopping- in fact shopping centres on both sides .
so you can categorised your shopping .
up market you can go to marina bay sands and % uh for lesser price items , lower price items you can do your shopping in chinatown .
and- i 'm glad to be able to help you i hope you enjoy your stay and your daughter too .
yes i hope to knock in to you or meet you , alright .
okay , bye .
welcome .
bye .
hello .
good morning .
hi eric .
my name is jeanne .
and i 'm tour guide number two .
how are you eric ?
i 'm fine .
how can i help you eric ?
% oh that would be- yes .
formula one is in september .
% uh usually , i think the third week of september .
% uh who are you traveling with ?
who are you traveling with ?
all by yourself just to watch formula one ?
okay .
okay .
so it 's % uh- the races would be friday , saturday and sunday usually .
so it 's twenty first to twenty third of september .
two days means you wants only one night in singapore ?
% oh okay .
so one night .
yes .
then you 'll have lots of money for your ticket .
% uh you do n't want to visit anywhere else in singapore ?
okay .
i think if you- % hm if you come in early in the morning , you might be able to % uh do maybe just walk around your hotel i think .
and save yourself for the race .
let me see the- sorry ?
you 're gon na ask me something ?
you can buy the ticket for the two days .
% uh let me see .
yah .
the ticket price , just a minute .
% uh early bird tickets you can buy , it would be a big cheaper if you are sure to be coming .
so you still qualify for the early bird race % uh purchase .
can you see ?
% oh i 'm afraid it 's a minimum of four tickets .
yah one to three tickets are thousand dollars .
% uh wait , let me see .
you can buy at places that are not so premium for watching .
the bay grandstand ?
the bay grandstand you get a view of the- okay let me tell you the difference .
the bay grandstand you get a view of the % uh bay that has been turned into a reservoir .
padang grandstand , it is our old colonial district .
you would be able to see maybe a longer stretch of them racing .
starting line , i 'm not very sure , where they start the race .
let me try and find out for you .
% uh but let me have a look at the tickets first , huh ?
okay .
i think it 's the waterfront grandstand if i 'm not mistaken .
i can not remember exactly .
but for your tickets % uh if you buy one ticket at bay grandstand it 's only about two hundred and fifty dollars .
if you buy-
let me see .
% oh it doesn't- three da~ it 's a three-day ticket category .
and you- so you can actually come in one day earlier and watch all you know the , yes three days .
okay .
maybe we can find out from here where they start % uh the race .
yes .
we close our streets and we have lots of concerts .
okay ?
so the race starts at the pit here .
can you see ?
that 's right .
yes that 's right .
the one at the waterfront bay is here .
and this is all the sea .
and the race continues down and this is the padang .
so there is another padang % uh stand tickets .
that 's the one that is two hundred over dollars i believe .
one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars .
straight line , yes .
but you get a very good view of the drivers , you know .
if they are overtaking % uh doing something rather dangerous you can see because some of the bends there are- it 's a bit dangerous for them .
i do n't think they overtake at those corners .
if i was a driver , that 's what i would do .
i 'm not sure what they would do % um-
yes .
it 's two hundred and forty eight .
so you can say it 's about two hundred and fifty dollars .
i 'm not sure but the tax , let me see , % huh , the ticket prices , let me go back to it .
because this is % uh billed through sistic .
it should include , i mean if they put in taxes , it will be a odd figure with a few cents .
i think it includes .
it does .
because it- there is no exclusion that taxes are not included .
all your credit cards % uh would be acceptable .
% oh yes .
you 'll have lots of money to shop because you 're staying only one night .
% uh do you want to stay in a nice hotel in chinatown ?
more pocket money for shopping ?
then you would book a bed in a hostel .
that 's not very comfortable , right , for twenty dollars ?
you have a lot of money left over for shopping .
% uh or do you want to just have a room that is not so expensive ?
maybe around hundred dollars ?
% oh all our hostels are safe .
even our backpackers joints are safe .
they have been checked over .
and usually you 'll have lockers .
you want a cheap , safe accommodation , is it ?
% uh , okay .
% uh and you do n't mind if % uh you have outside bathrooms and % uh- the places i 've checked out before , they- on the pictures they look very clean .
% oh so you want to have your own bathroom .
well even at the backpackers joints % uh there are some a little bit better value in the sense that % uh for those who want privacy let 's see if we can find one for you here .
okay ?
% oh yes .
if you are having a room , definitely .
and even the backpackers joints , they have air conditioning .
because here we are rather warm and humid .
so air conditioning is like a must in hotels .
and if you are serious about coming , i suggest you book the rooms straightaway because at that time % uh the rooms run out very fast .
so just give us a moment .
if you book now , in fact , i think you can get your room .
% uh the category that you want a little bit easier .
if you book-
% uh it depends on the hotel .
% uh nowadays , the hotels know that this is a peak period .
so i do n't think you 'll get a discount .
% um in the regular hotels in fact you 'll have to pay more like in the first class hotels % uh they charge more .
okay .
do you want to see our rooms first ?
we are trying to % uh find out .
okay .
let me see whether we can get a picture of this- whether they have rooms for you because it says twenty eight dollars which would not be a room i think .
but % uh-
they have- % uh let 's see if they have- they usually show the lowest price .
% uh okay .
see they have- % oh no . % oh , can you see that it 's a mix dorm ?
can you see on your pre~ screen ?
so that would be six-bed mix dorm .
and % uh it 's thirty three dollars a night .
single room for under fifty dollars , i think that 's a bit tough .
% uh that 's a bit tough .
closer to a hundred dollars , you might be able to get a room % uh of your own .
% oh so if you spent- % uh % oh you mean if you s~ your ticket is two hundred and fifty dollars , you have seven hundred and fifty dollars left .
that's- wow .
two hundred and fifty dollars will get you a hotel room .
% uh okay .
let me try and find one for you .
% uh but two hundred and fifty is actually a very great , good , great hotel .
you do n't really need two hundred and fifty dollars .
in some hotels , you would be able to get two nights .
so , let 's say less than a hundred dollars .
let us try less than a hundred .
so then you can stay two nights , right ?
okay .
so- okay this one- little india is actually not less than a hundred .
but , this is a good hotel here .
it 's a hundred and fifty eight .
can you see ?
fortuna hotel .
this is in little india .
it 's a good area .
then we have budget class .
% uh the first two that states little india , you are very near to town and you can get to your race very easily by the trains .
% oh if you do that , you will bust your budget .
% uh because if you- the hotel rates will go up during that time for the budget class hotels .
so-
even though you book in advan~ no . even though you book in advance .
because the hotels know that it 's a very popular period .
and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax .
% uh so they bill it into the room rates .
so i think your priority to- is to book your hotel first and- or tickets .
then you have tide in your cost for your trip .
you know the two important things for you and the rest of it you can use for shopping .
so this is a good hotel .
can you see % uh the one that 's hundred and fifty five dollars ?
% uh santa grand hotel bugis .
it 's also just one stop away from the race venue .
it 's in a shopping area .
it 's also fairly new .
i have % uh passed by a few times .
and looks % uh quite good from the outside .
% uh one or two stars .
yah , we do n't go by the star system in singapore because it 's too restrictive on pricing .
but maybe i would call it two-star .
% uh lavender street .
let me see .
beach hotel , you can also walk to the race area .
hundred and thirty dollars .
% uh broadway hotel is in little india .
you can take a train .
that 's a hundred dollars .
you 'll save some money .
it 's okay if you take just one stop .
% uh and in fact for one stop , i think you can walk .
i 'm assuming you 're quite young , right ?
yes .
so % uh that 's not a problem .
it's- if you would travel far , then you waste time traveling .
and there are also maybe traffic jams and % uh- because there is road closure % uh for where the races run .
so traffic is diverted .
% uh if you 're on the beach road hotel , you- it 's a very short walk .
i mean i would walk it .
i mean i suppose you could hop up a bus and take it for one stop .
but % uh there may not be buses there .
if it 's diverted , it will affect the bus route also .
so you might as well walk .
yes .
that 's right .
so you can take the- % uh beach hotel then you walk .
or you can take % uh broadway hotel that 's in little india .
it 's quite interesting % uh because- well if you do n't go anywhere , you just walk around the area .
% uh lots of things to see , hindu temples .
% uh are you bringing your camera ?
so you can , in the early morning % uh when you are not involved in the- watching the races , you can % uh take photographs of the % uh people going there to shop , the people praying in the hindu temples , the flower garland makers .
so you can do , you know , things that tourist normally do .
you 'll get a lots of souvenir photographs when you go home .
what we had-
% uh some of them do , some of them do n't .
but in this area at broadway hotel , it does n't really matter because all around you are cafes and % uh also restaurants .
you can eat at the little cafes .
they are like coffee shops .
and if you 're vegetarian , lots of vegetarian food .
if you want some- do you eat indian food ?
% uh so you can get north indian which is less spicy .
you can get south indian if you like your curries hot .
you can have vegetarian and it would be just a few dollars .
yes .
i think under five dollars would be more than enough .
if you pay for the breakfast in the hotel , i believe they would cost-
they would cost you in a higher- cost you more and then they put in a buffet spread , you know , jam and eggs and ham and you know the stuff that % uh hotels normally provide .
so- yes , you will .
so here .
let me see was it hun~ did it say a hundred dollars - hundred and forty here it says .
so single without breakfast right up to december is a hundred and forty dollars .
yes .
so i think they do n't provide breakfast here .
yes , for one night .
that 's right .
if you have two days , then you % uh little bit more relax , you know .
after you have landed and you have a bit more time to sightsee .
so two fifty for the tickets another two hundred and eighty for your two nights , right ?
so you have four hundred and seventy dollars left to spend .
if you- what are you looking for in shopping ?
i do n't have prices for the items .
but there 's a centre i will recommend you to .
it 's % uh an it centre .
so they have laptops , they have the peripherals .
and what i normally advice people to do is to go around the stores .
be honest and tell them you are checking prices and you 'll come back if they are giving you a good deal .
yes .
% uh in fact if you ask me , i think little india looks like a flea market with all the stalls filling out into the street .
but you can go to a place called bugis , where we have a little lane and there are lots of little stalls selling very low priced % um souvenirs .
% uh one of the souvenirs that should people normally buy is of the merlion % uh sort of- % uh just an ornament to put on the table .
% uh depends on the size of the item .
they have them really small for people who want tiny things .
and they have them bigger and it depends on , you know , what it is made of .
so if you go to a good class store , it might cost you fifteen , twenty dollars .
if you buy it on the street side , i think would be two , three dollars , you should be able to get it .
it 's not expensive .
now here , you ca-
so here is an air conditioned area % uh within a shopping mall that is next to a hotel in the same district of bugis .
and what we 've done is we 've conserved the old buildings .
can you see the windows here ?
on the right side .
% uh no . this is- well there is food all around .
but here it seems to be having a food fair .
so that , i think that was when it was photographed .
but generally , they have stalls selling a whole lot of things .
if you want to buy % uh scarfs for your girlfriend , you want to buy handbags or you want to buy % uh like you say souvenirs .
you can get them here .
so if you think it 's too hot and you want somewhere air conditioned , you can shop in here .
but just opposite is the lane where you % uh have shops on your left and right .
and you have a whole range of items from % uh t-shirts that young people like to wear , % uh and % uh even buddha statues , % uh cd 's even at times .
and this is some of the food you can eat .
well , do you like curry ?
or you prefer something that is not so hot ?
okay .
okay .
here can you see the stall here on your left ?
can you see the ch~ no , that 's chicken .
very fat chicken .
and right at the end of the brown bird you can see a pale white one .
% uh at these stalls , you usually can get two kinds % uh roasted or you can get it a normal chicken rice .
% uh the chicken is boiled with pandan .
do you know pandan leaves that are fragrance ?
and so % uh the chicken is boiled and then the soup that is used to boil the chicken , is used to cook the rice .
and in the rice they tie up pandan leaves to give the rice fragrance .
and they add a little bit of oil so the rice in itself , in fact when i was a child i used to eat a lot of just the rice .
we pour thick black sauce over it .
and if you like to have it hot , then you take a vinegarish chili .
the chili is ground with % um a little bit of vinegar sauce .
but if you do n't like , that 's optional .
and the chicken is very delicious .
you can also eat .
% uh yes .
yes .
and then you get a soup .
the soup comes free of charge .
% uh sometimes they have a fix deal three dollars a plate .
% uh sometimes it 's two dollars .
but i think two dollars will not be enough for you .
and also the cuts of meat , you know .
if you want to have the thigh of the chicken which is very popular , maybe you have to pay three fifty .
and some places- yah at fifty cents per rice .
they will charge you another fifty cents .
yes .
that is something that 's a favourite with locals and with tourist as well .
some- okay .
something that 's very nice % uh that % uh we like and tourist like and the restaurants are- the food vendors are very good at .
they will make it with a little bit less chili .
if you want to save money for shopping then you go for the side street vendors .
if you want to have % uh to pamper yourself , then you can eat at the restaurants .
% uh the dish i am recommending is chili crab .
% uh so- usually at the restaurants .
% uh normally this meal you share it with friends because it 's finger licking good .
and as you break up the crab , they give you something to- they 've smashed the crab a little bit so that you can get at the meat inside % uh the shell .
but then % uh there are parts of it you ca n't reach so they give you a little fork to dig in .
and then you % uh- buns .
can you see here at the description ?
served with steam deep fried buns .
these are very nice and soft buns % uh with nothing inside .
so you dip this bun into the gravy .
yes .
that 's right .
it 's mantou that is % uh usually served in chinese food .
when i was young , we % uh just add it with plain white bread .
so what- if you order this , i suggest you just order this and do n't order anything else .
so you can eat the whole crab .
% uh yes .
but this is a mantou with just a slice .
and then it 's empty .
it 's empty inside .
so the idea is that instead of eating rice , you use the mantou to wipe out the sauce and eat that .
that would be your carbohydrate .
it 's a sweet .
% uh not so sweet .
it 's chili with % uh sweet sauce so that the sweetness balances the chili .
it goes by the crab .
so it varies with the price of the crab .
it could be maybe i would say not more than forty dollars .
a whole crab , yah .
% uh maybe thirty- i 'm estimating on the highest side in case the price of the crab goes up at the time .
% uh the thing is they sell it by the crab and they will weigh the crab .
no . % uh i do it all the time .
but % uh as i said , this dish is very nice if you have a few people to share .
then you order things like vegetables .
and let me see what do we have here .
i ca n't recognise this dish .
let 's have a look at this .
% oh this is-
% uh yah .
clams steamed and they have mixed garlic .
and it 's a light dish .
so this % uh clams , they actually looked like bamboo .
that 's why they 're called bamboo clams .
no . would- this would be much less .
maybe twelve fifteen .
it varies with the restaurants .
% uh the- jumbo is a very popular restaurant and it 's got a few branches .
they have one restaurant which is very near to the f one % uh race track .
it 's along the river .
and so it 's very convenient for you .
no . i do n't think they raise their prices .
% uh they only li- raise prices % uh for some restaurants during the lunar new year .
% uh but if they raise prices , it would be , you know , on the menu or they would be assigned to tell you .
they would n't suddenly give you a bill , you know , that is higher than what 's on the menu .
so you can see- can you see a view of the restaurant ?
it 's a nice place .
yes .
that is the river which is right next to the f one % uh race track .
and it opens out into the marina bay which is now our reservoir .
% uh which collects rainwater that falls in the city .
so , you know , the ambiance is very nice .
you just have to look at the menu before you order and ask them to weigh the crab .
and that you do n't have to eat the crab if you do n't like .
you can have steamed prawns .
you can have a fish .
% uh generally in singapore , the fish and crabs and prawns % uh would be the higher price items .
if you are vegetarian , it 's much cheaper to eat .
if you buy it from the street vendors , % uh you are getting more singaporean taste .
you know what i mean ?
% um you are getting what i would be eating without busting my budget .
if you go into the restaurants , you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist .
that means the chili maybe a little bit left out .
% uh if you are buying off the street , you can ask them-
you- well you can ask them to reduce the chili .
when they can , they will reduce it for you .
but otherwise , for two dollars or three dollars , they will give you what they have .
and you know % uh it would be maybe a little bit more adventurous .
the vendors in little india are very accommodating .
they 're very friendly .
so i eat there quite often .
and you would obviously look like a tourist .
so they would be happy to accommodate you .
four hundred dollars to spend ?
% uh or to shop ?
to spend , that 's a lot of money .
i do n't spend that much in a week .
% uh it's-
yah .
no . that 's a lot of money in singapore .
yes for food .
you can even eat your crab .
% uh you will still have money left over .
and you can eat street food also .
you do n't want to blow it all on restaurants , right ?
so in little india , if you eat in the little cafes , % uh it will cost you % uh ten dollars if you order more than one dish .
if you will order- yah .
if you walk in , % uh there 's a little indian restaurant opposite a hindu temple .
the road is called veerasamy road .
i do n't think they are on the internet .
but they will have different % uh vegetarian like pancakes cooked with unions , % uh cooked with potatoes inside .
they 're just between one dollar and maybe two fifty .
that 's all .
so it 's not expensive .
ethnic food would be the food you get in little india .
in chinatown , would be the chinese food .
chicken rice and chili crab are very singaporean because we % uh supposed to have adopted the chicken rice from china but we have revolutionalised it , so it 's totally our own brand .
and the chili crab also .
% um during chinese new year , we have another one .
it 's called yusheng that we tossup .
it 's a salad that we eat .
and that 's also singaporean .
but that 's normally you get it when you come before the lunar new year .
no , they serving that .
because it 's superstitious when we eat that as we add the ingredients and we toss it up .
we say auspicious things in chinese to bring us wealth , good health , lots of grandchildren and things like that .
yes .
it 's very nice .
% uh you 've got to come before the new year because during the chinese new year , some of the restaurants maybe closed for the first day or the second day to give their staff a break .
% uh you have to check the chinese calendar .
so it changes because it 's not a gregorian calendar .
okay .
you want to-
you wanted to % uh buy some % uh computer peripherals .
is that right ?
you were mentioned it just now ?
okay .
% uh we have- wait .
let me show you funan centre first .
it's- yes .
it 's a mall .
it's- % uh when it 's open , it 's dedicated to computer items .
information technology shops .
and can you see city hall there ?
so it 's just next door to city hall .
it is in the area but % uh city hall and the supreme court right now they are molded up % uh for the- % uh they are no longer functioning as % uh court or government officers , but they are gon na be turn into one big % uh museum and art gallery .
so , you know , % uh it 's not there for you to photograph .
it would n't look so nice .
no . not restricted .
and the actual court is just behind it .
so if you look at the padang .
can you see connaught drive ?
sort of where the word singapore is ?
% uh if you are booking your tickets , you 'll be sitting right here opposite connaught drive .
and behind it would be funan mall .
so your computer shops are there .
and then if you have time at night , you can walk along % uh the river .
can you see boat quay ?
you- can see you a little blue curvy line ?
that 's our historic river .
and there are- okay .
yes . so do you see boat quay ?
yes . so do you see boat quay ?
it 's on the opposite banks of % uh the hill street area where the road name is shown .
so can you see % uh merchant road ?
so before merchant road , it 's right along the river .
it 's along there .
if you walk along it , you can not miss it .
it 's a short walk .
i walk much more than that every time i 'm in the area .
if you walk fast , just five minutes .
otherwise if you are looking at things which i presume you will be doing , maybe ten minutes .
there is also an interesting museum just behind % um where you see the boat quay name ?
can you see ?
so across the river from there is the asian civilisation 's museum .
and you can visit that too .
% oh i do n't know about the history channel .
% uh this museum shows you the early history of singapore in the front foyer .
and % uh-
yes that 's right .
that 's the old british office that used to be a government office .
let me get it for you .
% uh not inside the exhibits there .
because % uh i think one is for security reasons and sometimes people forget to switch off their flash and you would fade the exhibits .
and they have , you know , old fabrics and % uh artifacts that would suffer from too much light .
so for some of the exhibits , it 's actually a little bit dim .
so we have an exhibit on south asia that would be india .
we have one there you see some of the statues that we have on display ?
yes but you check with the security before you enter % uh just to be sure , yah .
% um we have an southeast asian exhibit .
% uh this is my favourite .
it 's west asia .
it 's a room where you find out about % uh the islamic culture and they have got old calligraphy , % uh small little e~ korans , you know , the holly book for the muslims with hand drawn calligraphy .
if you like , you can also visit this museum , the peranakan museum which is also nearby .
% uh for the asian civilisation 's museum , the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river , that one- that one is % uh free of charge .
so if you go too late and you think you have no time % uh then i suggest you go to visit just the outside area and you can take photographs from there into the river .
so you get a good view .
okay .
can you see this picture here ?
% uh so let me see , huh .
so the acm is here .
your % um seats for watching the f one is where the cricket club is just around the corner .
so walking distance and your % uh rice , chicken - % uh sorry your chili crab is down boat quay just a little bit further down .
let me see if i can get the prices for you .
i know it 's ten dollars only .
yes .
it should n't be more than ten dollars in fact eight dollars .
okay .
very affordable .
and you may even get it free , that 's talk about allowing you free entry to the museums .
yes .
there is a museum shop but % uh the souvenirs are very good quality .
so they are not low price .
% uh although they do have certain items on sale now and then .
i think souvenirs you get from chinatown and little india you would save money .
% uh and then you can buy your computer it products from funan centre .
four hundred dollars is a lot of money .
you can eat your chili crab .
yes % uh-
yes .
% uh the indian restaurants there % um in little india .
so-
the- if you take the beach road - the hotel that was located at beach road , that one is walking distance .
if you take the one-
yes .
if you take the one in little india , you have to take a train .
unless you do n't mind walking a little bit more .
yes .
do you want to see a map of the % uh train ?
the so~
'cause i think i have n't shown you that , right ?
it goes by distance .
so it depends on how far you travel .
and from what you have planned , it 's not very far .
so % uh maybe the longest distance would be from the airport to the city .
so you get your ticket from the basement of changi airport .
can you see on the right side of your map ?
yah .
okay that 's station number three .
you take it to tanah merah .
and you have to get off and switch on a train that goes westwards .
and when you go down westwards , you travel down .
if you are going to book into the hotel in little india , you switch- you- i think you go all the way down to outram park , that would be easier .
and then you get off and get on what we call the north east line which is purple .
can you see the purple line ?
so that 's outram park very near to chinatown .
you turn north east .
there are hotels also in chinatown but you can carry on to little india .
and that 's only one , two , three , four stops .
that would be maybe your most expensive ride % hm under three dollars , singapore money .
yes .
and the rest of your rides would be from little india % uh down to- if you want to go to chinatown , it 's two stops .
you can also stop at clarke quay which is % uh-
yah it 's the river .
yes .
and you could walk from clarke quay % uh to the f one sites .
% uh and also to where you eat .
yes .
you see the bay .
so when you take photographs , you have the bay in your background .
% um and when you walk around , you can see the marina bay sands which is one of our two % um integrated resorts .
beautiful view for the background .
if you % uh do n't want to get off at clarke quay , you can also go to city hall from dhoby ghaut .
can you see ?
you switch to city hall station .
and that 's also in the area .
% uh city hall is maybe a little bit nearer- two minutes nearer to where you would be seated for your show .
for your- well i call it a show for the f one race .
it 's a mix .
it's- part of it is above ground .
when you come down from the airport , you get a good view until kallang , yes .
and then it goes underground because that area is built-up .
and in the chinatown area , it is all % uh built-up so it is underground .
but when you go out of the city , it is above ground for some parts .
% uh the purple line is mostly underground .
almost all of singapore .
but it 's also integrated with a bus system .
so for example % uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange , there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt .
at dhoby ghaut , there are lots of buses as well and at city hall .
we also have a bus information board behind where you sit , you can read off and find information .
where about- you know where the buses would bring you to .
it follows a strict schedule but we ca n't control the traffic .
so the traffic- if there is a build-up of traffic , then there would be a delay .
% hm sometimes we grumble because the same bus number comes- two of the buses come together .
but it 's not the fault of the driver or the scheduler .
it 's because of the traffic .
no . that- it 's not twenty four hours .
% uh past midnight .
for the f one , they would be extended for sure .
% uh they would publicize it that they would extend it maybe for an hour or two .
because they know a lot of people need to get home and so they need to provide the % uh transportation .
we also have a night rider system where the buses bring people from areas like % uh chinatown , % uh the night clubbing areas back into the major cities .
this is more to service singaporeans who have a night out and you know they do n't drive .
they can get home near enough to their homes .
the- % uh unsafe area ?
i really can not think of any unsafe area as long as you do n't % um , you know , wear jewelry like gold chain and gold % uh you know some people- some men like to wear gold bracelets , you know , that are solid gold and cost thousands of dollars now .
so if you do that , you probably might invite trouble .
% uh one place that 's a bit shady is called geylang .
but to me , it 's very colourful .
i have been there .
it 's % uh- we have some- let me see if i can get you pictures there .
it is a little bit out of the way .
% uh you get authentic food there .
you can also- can you see on your screen ?
okay .
% uh i hope you will come and remember to buy your tickets early so that you can % uh enjoy the cheaper rate for the hotel before it gets filled up .
okay .
alright .
you do n't want to wait for the picture of geylang ?
no ?
okay .
alright then .
goodbye .
goodbye .
thank you .
thank you .
bye .
bye eric .
bye .
hello .
hello , good morning or good afternoon .
this is jeanne .
guide number two .
how are you maggie ?
i 'm fine too .
how can i help you maggie ?
you want to bring your dog ?
d o g , dog ?
did you say ?
i 'm afraid you ca n't do that , because your dog will have to be quarantined .
yes .
so , % um if you bring it in your dog will still not be with you .
he will be put in quarantine .
you can not carry your dog with you in the hotel and bring it into singapore .
yes .
you have to find someone to babysit .
one-
one week ?
% uh what is your % uh intention ?
you want to have a room or are you willing to go backpacker style .
so , you want to save money for shopping .
for wha~ okay .
okay .
so you want backpacker , but you want to have a room .
or rather the lowest priced rooms that you can get .
is that it ?
% oh you like a bit of luxury .
we will look for it and see whether we can % uh accommodate you .
but how much money are you going to spend ?
is that for yourself ?
is your boyfriend sharing % uh like he 's gon na put in another thousand ?
well- % uh tours , you can do yourself .
let me see if i can get you % uh rooms .
because you really- you do n't want dormitory .
you also want to have % uh a room , right ?
so-
okay , % uh % hm .
% oh so that 's not really backpacker , right ?
that would be a hotel .
% uh not a very high price hotel .
okay .
let me see .
what is your interest ?
okay , animals .
% uh anything else ?
okay .
% oh yes , of course .
then , there are lots of shops all over singapore .
okay .
here are some hotels here .
we have to look at your budget .
le~ let 's look at under a hundred .
well , at- what is shown here this one at eighty-five .
it 's a bit high price .
i mean , sorry .
it 's a bit low price , but it 's % uh bit out of the way .
% uh it is in what- some of us considered a little shady part of singapore .
full of colour actually .
i think with your boyfriend it should be okay .
but you have to walk a little distance to where the trains are .
% uh if you 're in town , this is a bit better .
yes , % uh-
now , you- if you look at the screen , there are hotels .
in chinatown .
the keong saik hotel at ninety dollars .
and we also have in little india asphodel inn .
% uh race course road is % uh in little india and it 's eighty dollars .
so , what is your preference to be ?
in an area where you can get out and get chinese food ?
or where you can get indian food easily ?
% uh if you stay in chinatown .
you are closer to places like % uh museums .
and some of the train stations .
and you can also get indian food in chinatown .
and it 's only a short distance .
two to three stops through little india .
where you can choose from a whole variety of indian food .
yes , that 's right .
keong saik street .
% uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal .
because it 's right in town .
% uh and it is near the civic district , which is our historic area and near the river .
so , very easy .
okay .
let 's have a look here .
so is- can you see ?
it's-
wi-fi .
it does n't say wi-fi , right ?
do i see wi-fi ?
no , i do n't se-
we have internet access here .
can you see ?
in your room .
it 's very good .
can you see it won in a ha~ architectural heritage award ?
yes , that- that means the building is a pretty building .
okay .
okay , just a minute .
i 'm trying to get you a bigger picture of it .
yah , this is the picture .
it 's in a conservation area .
and the buildings were totally renovated .
so , they would maybe late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds .
i 'm not very clear on the exact date .
but they have been totally refurbished and redone .
so , they got an award because they have done it sensibly .
so , you are in % uh one of my favourite districts with all these history around you .
and yet you have clean rooms .
you have % uh the convenience of % uh shopping just outside .
food .
so , i will-
show you where it is .
okay .
i will show you on the map in a little while .
there is a stop on the trains .
but you will have to change trains .
which i think is not a problem for you .
right ?
% uh it is- as our system is known as mass rapid transit .
and it is % uh a mixture of above ground and below ground .
yes .
and there is % uh two stops that will bring you near here .
one is the outram park .
the other one is on the other side and it 's called chinatown .
so , you can just walk to where your hotel is .
it 's on % uh slightly quieter part of chinatown .
there are other hostels in the other side lanes .
where we have food stalls and souvenir shops .
so , this is a nice lane .
% uh that used to be a red light district , but no more .
in my grandfather 's time , it was .
no . it ' s not a red light district at all .
% uh not really only for tourist .
for locals as well .
it 's just the hotels are aim at the tourist .
% uh but the food and the % uh- i mean singaporeans visit the place .
you will know when you visit there .
you 'll see a lot of locals shopping , eating .
so , % uh you soak in the atmosphere .
they would understand english .
if you speak slowly .
and if you are negotiating prices .
what i do when i visit % uh some other countries is that i bring a calculator .
and i key in the amount i want to pay for whatever i 'm buying .
yes .
and so that 's because you do n't want them to misunderstand you .
but- most of the shopkeepers and the people who sell things along the roadside , they understand basic english .
so , it should not be a problem .
you may have problem understanding them .
because we speak singlish .
we combined english with chinese grammar .
singlish .
yes .
singapore english .
okay .
no , singlish % uh .
the- yes , % uh % uh .
% uh so if you ca n't understand them , just ask them to repeat what they are saying .
% uh yes % uh but if i went to chinatown .
i sort of naturally speak singlish a little bit .
% uh because i adopt what people are telling me .
so % uh singlish for example , why you 're so like that ?
do you understand me ?
'cause-
yes .
we had % uh singer composer who is very popular .
who composed songs and music with using singlish .
% uh occasionally , we 've got malay words thrown in .
but % uh it is very local .
% uh that will leave you a lot of money for shopping if you just- you see , if you spend two days ninety dollars , you can spend two days , right ?
so , huh ?
yes . it 's a hundred and eighty dollars .
yes . it 's a hundred and eighty dollars .
so , you said you wanted animals ?
so-
yes .
can i get you singapore wildlife safari or singapore wildlife reserves ?
the reserves is the % uh governing body for the bird park , the zoo and the night safari .
and , the zoo and night safari are next to each other .
so , i suggest you buy a ticket for all three attractions .
and you could visit all three in a day or you could do two on one day .
and spend a morning at the bird park and you have the afternoon free .
% uh when i get back to the screen i 'll show you .
it 's on the west line and you 'll just have to connect .
and take a short bus ride there .
okay .
so , here you 're seeing a free-flight aviary within the jurong bird park , which is part of the wildlife reserves .
yes .
% uh very good for photography .
% oh you can see the show and you can- when you enter , you just get a leaflet ,
or if they have % uh more specific brochure on the timings .
if there is none printed out , you just ask the girl at ticketing .
the guest relation officers will advise you % uh when are the feeding times .
but -- - so , where you saw the birds feeding just now ,
they usually put out bird food and fruits .
very near to the pathway where you are walking .
at feeding time if the keeper is there , he will % uh- you can buy let 's say of just a few dollars for the bird feed .
and you can either hold it up in your little plastic container .
or if you are brave , you put the seed on your hand , and they will feed of your hand .
yes .
% uh can i show you the other attractions first and then i come to the pricing ?
so , this is the bird park .
so , this is at a different location from where the zoo and the night safari are located .
% uh because the zoo and night safari are just next door to each other .
so , if we look at the zoo .
yes . so , i suggest to-
yes . so , i suggest to- because the night safari opens at seven .
so , you visit the zoo in the afternoon , and the night safari in the evening .
the same day .
so , you just walk across .
that 's % uh a new nudist .
% uh it is a mole rat .
yes .
and it does n't have any hair .
so , that 's why they called it a nudist % uh colony .
yes .
but % uh they will not be in your face , you know .
% um it 's optional whether- % uh in fact , i do n't think you will be able to handle the mole rats .
% uh you- % uh at the night safari , yea , i 'm gon na show you now .
there is a show and you can- after the show they 'll bring out some of the animals .
if you like to handle a snake .
well , that might be an opportunity for you .
% uh only the ones that come out with the keepers .
you- we wo n't let you introduce snake enclosure .
% um but they 'll be able to find you after that .
% uh in the zoo that i showed you just now , we have % uh reptile enclosure that you can go in .
but , i think you leave your boyfriend outside .
so you-
% uh you can see the giraffes here .
we just had a new baby born .
and-
so , here we have the % uh- there is a tram ride and there 's also % uh walking trail .
so , if you walk fast and you are not too tired out , you can take the tram ride .
and after that , do the walking trail .
okay , just % uh maybe an hour if you walk slowly .
because you say you like animals , that would be fun , right ?
safari animals like i said after the show , they bring them out and you can handle them , have your boyfriend take photos with you .
% uh the interaction in the daytime - in the day zoo , so it 's when you go for , first with the orangutans .
and , that means you would go for the zoo visit for a whole day .
you would stay for morning till afternoon .
unless you take a break and journey to the bird park and comeback for the night safari .
because at the breakfast time , you have your breakfast , the orangutans have their breakfast , and then % uh can go up and take photos with the orangutans .
% uh on the other hand , % um during the showtime also at the zoo .
you can opt to buy food and feed the animals .
the- the keepers will be there with the food .
so , it is actually managed by the keepers .
so , they want to keep it under control .
they ca n't actually take out the cookies and feed the animals .
yah .
that 's right .
so , do you want to know the ticket prices ?
% uh wait .
let me show you the opening hours and the rates % um . so , night safari .
this is the leopard cat .
you are only allowed in after dark .
those are anteaters .
they are really beautiful .
can you see seven-thirty to twelve ?
so , you-
% uh beca- the daytime is what we called the singapore zoo .
and so , there is a price saving .
can you see here thirty-two dollars admission and tram ?
% uh just a minute .
have a look at this chart here .
can you see at the bottom night safari and zoo ?
it 's only forty-two dollars .
so , you get a big discount .
% uh so if you are visiting the bird park as well .
you 'll pay fifty-eight dollars .
and that same ticket you 'll visit all three attractions .
normally , you would have thirty days to use up the ticket .
so , in your two days for sure you would use it up within the thirty-day limit .
no , you can use it on separate days .
as long as it 's within thirty days of the time you buy it .
so , the first visit whether it 's a bird park , zoo or night safari , you can buy this ticket .
% uh except if you are buying , you know bird park and night safari , of course you wo n't be at the zoo twice .
so , for the three-in-one at any of these parks , you buy the ticket and you make sure you keep the ticket .
so , they have the date on the ticket .
and they will tear off which ever portion they want for your visit .
yah , that 's the best deal .
it includes taxes .
% uh you are not a senior citizen , so you do n't get the-
so , that 's about sixty dollars or fifty-eight dollars for both of you .
right ?
so , that would be a hundred and twenty dollars .
correct ?
and you 've on~
you 've only spend three hundred dollars of your thousand dollars .
shopping areas .
okay .
shopping areas .
okay , just a moment .
you have a lot of money .
so , we are sending you to the % uh centre of the shopping area called orchard road .
it 's a long street , but it 's very walkable .
because % uh it 's now connected by underpasses , where we have shops even in the other pass .
so , you move from a place to place , and % uh where it 's exposed is just a little area .
so , it 's not very hot even if you walk .
so- % uh , no . the underpasses , yes it 's quite recent .
and % uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it .
so , that they can , you know do n't have to negotiate traffic light junctions .
and it 's a seamless travel from place to place .
so , here you 're seeing some of the scenes .
this is the little road off the main road .
we have bus and eating places alfresco .
behind there are also % um % uh restaurants in- usually , besides alfresco you have also % um indoor dining areas .
so , you can shop and eat and shop and eat .
% uh you are looking at some of the high end brands here .
less upscale ?
okay .
% uh you are in chinatown .
so , i suggest you shop in chinatown for your gifts .
if you have to buy lots and lots of gifts .
chinatown would be the place .
and also little india .
and you can do a bit of bargaining , but usually the prices are very good .
just give me a moment to show you the street scene .
there 's a lot of street side shopping in chinatown ,
where you can buy off the stalls % uh that are in front of the shops .
and you can also go into the shops to buy .
they are very competitive .
so , prices are attractive .
they would hang out signs like any three items for ten singapore dollars .
or if you buy one , it 's two dollars .
if you buy three , it 's five dollars .
yes .
% uh for us , it 's not like this .
it 's not a wholesale thing .
it is more % uh ap~ an offer to attract you to buy more than one item .
so , you get to % uh- let 's say a fan and % uh chopsticks .
it might be a mixed things or it might be just fan .
so , they do n't consider themselves % uh wholesale .
it 's just % uh a gimmick .
you know , like the package for visiting the zoo , the bird park , and night safari , to encourage you to buy more .
because they know it 's within the budget of tourists .
it attracts me as well .
so , sometime- when i travel , i buy some of these things to giveaway to people .
% uh % uh yes .
% uh when , you know it 's nice to give something to people when you are away also .
so , here something singapore .
yes .
you can get % uh fans .
that are printed with pretty flowers .
and you might want to bring one along .
so , that you can fan yourself as you are shopping .
and you can also get chopsticks .
wel- yes .
% uh we have the chinese medicinal shops that sell chinese herbs .
and they will even prescribe for you , if you have a particular ailment .
but , let 's have some of the shops first .
so , give me a moment .
we 'll try and get you pictures of some of the items in chinatown .
you can see % um broadly the street view .
can you see that ?
so , this is the scene .
yes .
it 's at the place called sago lane .
and it 's right next to a big buddhist temple called buddha tooth relic temple , which you can also visit if you wish .
% oh , yes .
it 's within walking distance .
maybe ten minutes if you walk slowly .
this part of chinatown is a little bit busier and has more traffic .
your side of , where your hotel is it 's quieter .
as- yap .
so , that 's % uh- that 's nice because you can walk and see these things , but you can go back to the quiet peaceful part of your hotel .
yes , beaches .
i suggest you go to sentosa island .
you 're just interested in swimming , right ?
okay , spas .
there are in chinatown .
% uh you will be able to see them as you walked around .
and they might have offers for you .
% uh generally , they charge about ninety-eight dollars .
but sometimes they go for sixty-eight and even less than that .
% uh they give you offers .
so that you will sign up as a member .
but % uh as a tourist , maybe % uh- no , these spas here % um more the upperscale ones .
i think the ones in chinatown are good .
you can also go again for what we called with foot reflexology .
yes . so , every both days you can go .
yes . so , every both days you can go .
it 's not expensive .
it 's about maybe- it depends on the time you take it from twenty to thirty dollars according to how long .
okay , let me show you beaches .
yes .
and it -
yes .
we have % uh universal studios there .
% uh and we 'll be have museums there .
two golf clubs there .
but the beach you see it 's nice and sandy .
there are beach umbrellas .
you can also eat there .
there are- there 's % uh inexpensive like a food court , where you have a variety of food .
where that you can order from .
and of~ okay .
can i show you the map on the mrt on the print system ?
so , you have a better idea of where you are .
okay .
% uh when you come in from the airport and you at number three .
and i 'll come- i 'll talk about the train system later .
you follow the green line .
and , it 's easier if you could take it all the way to outram park .
and then you switch to the northeast line .
that 's right .
and this stop is very near to your hotel .
% uh well , i count in time of minutes .
maybe ten minutes or so .
very close .
% uh the other way if you want to go to sentosa ,
you take the same line .
the purple line .
and you go just two stops to harbourfront .
and there are two ways you can go into sentosa .
you can cross the road and take a light trail , which is at the upper level of a big shopping centre .
but it 's more convenient to just take the bus shuttle in .
so , you walk from-
yes .
you just have to walk a short distance when you come out of the train station .
you follow the signals to say that it goes to the bus terminals .
and just behind- can you see behind harbourfront here on the right-hand side ?
it 's not shown , but there 's a big bus terminals .
and the sentosa shuttle occupies % uh two bus lots .
very near to the- where you will be .
you just wait for the bus .
there will be someone there % uh to guide you .
and the bus will be marked sentosa .
so , you take it and it brings you straight in .
yes . on the island , the same bus .
yes . on the island , the same bus .
it runs a shuttle .
so , what you pay is just two dollars to enter the island .
and one dollar for the bus fare .
so , when you come out of the island , it 's free of charge .
in other words , they collect it when you enter .
and then they do n't collect anymore when you come out .
% uh % hm that- % oh when you reached the bus train in sentosa ,
i think the beach is quite near or you can- if the beach is not near , you can just take a shuttle to near the beach .
they are internal shuttles within sentosa .
% uh let me have a look .
just hold on minute .
i have % uh brochure of it .
and sentosa island , % uh siloso beach .
there are three beaches along sentosa .
so-
yes or could walk the whole distance from end to end .
and have a-
when you reached sentosa .
% uh you can take shuttle buses .
so , can you see getting there the different coloured lines ?
blue , red and green .
so , % uh these are the buses that fly to different areas in sentosa .
that 's right .
and there also a beach tram that you can take .
if you just want to have a fun ride on the beach tram , you wait for it .
it 's very popular .
% uh there are-
this is actually the beach .
so , you 're on the beach .
you 're subject to the weather and the waves .
it 's very natural .
it 's not % uh an artificial environment .
huh ?
if you want something exciting , % uh do you know how the ski on the water attached to lines ?
do you do things like that ?
% uh water skiing .
it is along-
no , not in sentosa , it 's on the east coast of singapore .
% um i forgot the name .
% uh it's- you have to be able to swim quite well .
% uh because the line brings you down into the water and you are held up by the line .
yah , let me see if i can get it on east coast parkway .
this is what- % oh if you want to wakeboard .
% uh we have a reservoir , it is called the % uh bedok .
there you go wakeboarding .
and this is a controlled environment .
it 's not the sea .
it 's a reservoir .
% uh we do n't have sharks in singapore .
% uh do n't mind actually it will be fun .
we do n't see some- we see dolphins occasionally .
but % uh yah it 's a little bit rare .
if you are on a boat ride out .
then you get to see % uh the dolphins .
% uh yes , i have % uh of- near to changi actually .
just for a second .
but he saw it .
so , it must have been real .
that 's right .
% uh we get turtles landing on our beach occasionally .
% um you ca n't really see it , because we find them accidentally .
and then , what happens is the public will inform underwater world , which is on sentosa .
it 's a lovely aquarium .
and-
you want to see the aquarium ?
% uh underwater world sentosa , okay .
yes , that is separate .
that would be on this island called sentosa , where you go to the beach .
so , you would cover this on the same day you go the beach .
okay .
can you see this ?
here instead of diving ,
yah % uh i 'm trying to-
just give us a moment .
so , what happened is let me described it to you .
you see % uh marine fishes , which are very colorful .
the ones in the tropics .
and you 'll see them in- displayed in % uh like an aquarium environment .
but you also get underground where there is a whole aquarium around you .
and , it 's like you are on display to the fishes .
yes , that 's right .
so , % uh th-
you will stand on the travelator ,
and there are signboards at the side to show you .
you know , usually what 's animal- % uh what species is there , they will display it .
and there 's also attached to this aquarium % uh dolphin show .
so , we have sharks .
you can even see baby sharks that are in the process of being % uh hatched , you know from the eggs .
in the show , you are seeing here , there 's a dolphin interacting .
% uh you will just pay a little fee , and it will get a little bit wet .
you do n't have to go all the way in .
but you can go down shake hands with the- no , not suppose-
okay , % uh underwater world .
% uh this is if you dive .
okay , a hundred and twenty dollars if you actually bring your diving suit and dive .
and if you swim , a hundred and seventy .
yes .
% uh no the sharks you do n't get to swim to do anything with them .
except see them behind glass .
% uh so that's- that no . it 's a very safe environment here in the singapore .
we do n't expose tourists to any risk .
and we think dolphins are pretty friendly .
% uh so , if you are prepared , then you need to bring your swimming costume .
yah and the- and the package includes a t-shirt souvenir , and your boyfriend can take your photograph for you .
so , that 's good right ?
you have money left over .
if you are generous and you want the fish to % uh have a nibble at your feet .
can you see fish reflexology ?
you put your fish- % uh put your feet .
sorry into % uh a very shallow % uh something like a pool , where they have tiny little fishes that nibble away at you- the dead skin of your- soles of your feet and all that .
yes , it's- % uh i tried it .
it 's a little bit ticklish .
so , some people enjoy it .
some people find it a little bit too ticklish .
% um but it 's fun .
pardon ?
% oh no . it 's not painful at all .
and it 's % uh quite popular .
so , you sit around and you can all laughter at each other .
% uh because some fish will maybe prefer a certain foot more than the other 's .
yes % uh so % uh we do n't have much time .
% um do you have anything else you would like to ask ?
% uh % hm , that 's very good .
so , you can % um have shopping money and you can apportion some of it to % uh maybe a treat for yourself .
and then the rest to % uh souvenirs that you want to buy for friends to bring back .
okay .
so , you 're comfortable taking the trains , you take the ez-link ticket from the basement of the airport .
you pay and deposit for the price you gon na spend .
and then you can get your refund before you leave singapore .
your welcome .
i hope i do see you in singapore .
fish spa , yes .
okay , right .
% uh maggie % uh nothing else to ask ?
okay .
look forward to see you maggie then .
bye .
welcome .
bye .
hello .
good afternoon .
i am jeanne .
guide number two .
% uh number thirteen .
how do you spell your name ?
is it d o d y ?
% oh d o d i e. and your number three zero , is that right ?
% uh % huh dodie .
how can i help you , dodie ?
yes , of course .
you need to- first , you sound like a young man , are you ?
yes .
very young .
% uh how many people will be travelling with you ?
okay .
and your fiancé would be the same age as you , right ?
okay .
% uh , when are you intending to travel ?
that 's the easter weekend , right ?
can you give me the exact dates of arrival and departure ?
okay .
% uh what are your interest ?
okay .
so you do~ you would like to watch a game in process % uh , while you are in singapore and also visit some attractions , is that right ?
okay , first % uh maybe we select a hotel for you and % uh i show you a map of singapore and so you know what 's the location of % uh the various places .
yes .
this is % um- when you come in from the airport -
when you come in from the airport you will land at changi airport which is in the eastern side of singapore .
you know singapore is n't very large .
seven hundred square kilometres .
so , okay .
so this is a portion of the map that 's interesting that is enlarged .
% uh do you see number three here at the right-hand side ?
% uh that 's the eastern corner of singapore .
and the various colours you see are the lines for the mass rapid transit .
% uh so it shows you the connectivity .
so from changi airport if you follow the green line down and you end at outram park , you can go to the harbourfront which- and it 's across from an island called sentosa , just opposite .
% uh and if you go the other way you are into chinatown a little bit further up .
dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles .
so three lines pass through there .
and so if you take the northeast- % uh sorry the north-south line , the red line , you will reach orchard road which is a major shopping and tourist belt .
% uh sentosa % uh has got many attractions .
so you need not % uh use up a lot of money if you for example see a show that's- and you do n't buy the top end tickets and in fact if you only go to the beach it will cost you only three dollars .
because there is no entry fee to the beach .
two dollars to go in , one dollar for the bus shuttle .
but whether on the island if you want to visit attractions then it's- % uh whichever attraction you pick % uh it has a fee .
okay .
first , % uh can i- you want me to pick you a hotel first ?
% uh , if you stay in chinatown , you can get to harbourfront and you can get to the island very quickly .
the hotels on the island would be a little bit pricier because they are , you know , normal hotels % uh , on resort islands .
so % uh of the top of per head about two hundred over dollars .
in chinatown , you can get them for around a hundred or even less .
and you can also stay in the heritage area known as little india .
and if you come out of there
to eat breakfast , lunch or dinner or pick up a midnight snack lots of such food in little india and chinatown .
% uh if you are at on sentosa , you probably have to go to the % uh restaurants along the beach or eat at the hotels .
so it will add to the cost .
% uh you do n't really have to stay in chinatown .
i 'm just giving you choices .
so if you stay in chinatown , you 've got more money to spend elsewhere .
so- % hm , okay .
so back to our map here .
% uh when you land at changi airport , % uh at the basement is the train line % uh station .
and you go and see the officer and you buy what we call an ezlink card % uh with a stored value and you can get a refund on the unused portion when you leave .
so this would be a very fast and inexpensive way to get into town .
a lots of tourist use it .
s~ you would not be bringing a huge bag , right ?
so % uh you can-
yah , that 's right .
so you take the train and the nice thing is it 's above ground .
so you 're getting a better view than if you are say in a taxi or , you know , walking .
anyway you would n't walk to town .
it 's a bit far .
it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground .
so this mass rapid transit is partially above ground where there are space and partially underground .
so you take it down to outram park and then you can switch to the purple which is the northeast line .
can you see it ?
and one-
yah , one stop you are in chinatown .
the- no , you do n't need to .
% um the stations will have signs and there will be an announcement on the trains before you get off .
so you just , you know , prepare yourself when you are at tanjong pagar for instance .
and then at outram park , you get off- you do n't get off the station , you just walk up or down another level .
walk down most probably .
and then you % uh switch to the purple line .
no , it 's the same % uh system .
it 's just another name it 's % uh developed .
the green line was developed , first the green and the red line and this is an additional line that goes straight up northeast .
so it makes it convenient .
an~ so you stay within the station .
you 're just going to another level and there will be many signs marked out .
there 'll also be people there willing to help you .
you can ask anybody around you .
they 'll be able to point you the way .
oh , they speak- % uh depends on who speak you to .
% um if they can not understand you , they will give you a look- a blank look .
and it could be a student from somewhere else or , you know .
% uh , someone whose not comfortable with english .
but i think by the third time you ask someone should be able to ask- % uh answer you .
yes , amazing race .
% uh but % uh i don't- is it on this weekend ?
do you know ?
because i do n't know the programme .
yes , yes .
i 've seen it on tv .
but % uh they had a singapore sector .
but i miss that .
oh no- % uh i am horrible with directions and i do n't have a problem .
you just % uh make sure that you are heading northeast .
so outside the train line there are signs to tell you which direction .
you take the direction that goes towards punggol .
can you see number seven on the top right inside ?
because you are going northeast .
and then when you 're going to sentosa you 'll take the direction that says harbourfront .
% uh anyway , when you buy your ticket , you should be able to get a map from the airport .
% uh and if you need help from the officer , he will tell you .
anyway , since you mentioned it .
at % uh the right-hand side of the map % uh can you see the green line ?
at tanah merah you need to get off and switch to go to town .
so this is where you go westwards .
yes .
so you just stand on the correct side of the station .
% um and % uh if you are not sure just ask anybody .
any of them who use that stop they are the people who work at the airport and they will be able to advice you .
no , it 's % uh usually given free .
and i think they have a large stock of it at the airport .
s~ so you want hotels in % uh chinatown , right ?
yes .
okay , i 'll get you the hotels in chinatown first in singapore and then if- you see what sort of culture % uh would you prefer around where you stay ?
is it chinese culture or indian culture ?
% ah okay .
okay , so chinatown is the best location because it 's near the singapore river where you can have althe- al fresco dining if you do n't want to eat outside your hotel .
and you can see we have a list of hotels here that are not very expensive .
but % uh decent hotels also .
just a minute .
we 're trying to catch it .
okay .
% uh let me get the ones in chinatown .
so can you see a list of the prices there ?
% uh if you want a quaint hotel % uh with nice design hotel nineteen twenty-nine .
the building dates from nineteen twenty-nine and it 's in a quiet -er part of the chinatown .
but it 's been completely refurbished .
all these hotels are- there 's nothing murky or dirty about it because it 's a conservation area .
% uh i 'm not sure .
if they did would probably % uh sell a ghost tour there .
no , not that i know of .
% uh the- you want to stay in a ghost hotel ?
oh you are strange .
okay % uh later- you can go and do shopping % uh at the street where people used to wait to die .
% uh it 's called sago lane at the other end of chinatown .
but it 's about ten minutes away .
% uh the other hotel if you want to save money , can you see the top hotel
here ?
keong saik , yes .
that 's on the same street and % uh i must tell you that this used to be a red-light district in my grandfather 's time .
but it 's all been cleaned up and % uh if you do n't want to have too much-
% uh to many people around your hotel , this is the quieter side of chinatown .
so , you want me to show you this hotel ?
okay .
i 've been in this area- i 've been in nineteen twenty-nine which invited travel agents and people in the- tour business to visit .
but i have n't been in this other one .
but i think it looks okay .
% uh no i have n't .
% uh but % uh you can see if there are any % uh ratings on the hotel .
% uh huh .
yes , on the same street .
yes .
yes , it 's very safe .
% uh it 's very safe .
% uh you can walk out 'til midnight , you know .
you can find places to have % uh supper .
the shops around there might close around ten o'clock .
but if you want to have a drink , i would prefer you go down to the singapore river where the ambiance is % uh by the singapore river .
okay .
if you look at this % uh picture of the hotel , can you see the building up there ?
and can you see additional remarks and notes ?
it won an architecture award in nineteen ninety-eight .
which means it was restored just about- completely restored about four years ago .
and so it 's quite new .
i do n't know ghosts % uh previous occupants .
you may .
o~ % uh nineteen twenty-nine has a very good reputation because the developer is % uh , you know , he develops small hotels .
so let me try and find you nineteen twenty-nine .
hotel nineteen twenty-nine - oh , sorry .
this hotel , i actually went inside .
i did n't stay here .
i just visited it when they had built it and they invited us from the travel industry to go in .
% uh what is interesting , i do n't know if this will % uh excite you is that they have a room the best room is in fact % uh at the rooftop .
these are low-rise buildings .
about 3 stories .
but you see the rating here ?
is four stars .
and if you'd- yah , huh .
if you take that room , you can have a shower in the open % uh with just , you know , like palm trees and plants % uh just all around you .
% uh the hotel owner and the staff tell us they have done a check and nobody from the nearby skyscraper , % uh business buildings can actually see you .
you do n't want to risk it .
i thought you 'd not scared of ghosts .
you would not be afraid of this .
you are actually surrounded .
it 's just the top , you know what i mean ?
it 's just the roof it 's not there .
okay then .
then % uh you can just take the suites .
can you see the rooms there ?
% uh the one i 'm talking about is the terrace suite .
you can-
oh .
you can take a-
a junior-
yup .
i am not sure about that .
% uh i think they 'd purposely put the the bathroom outside .
that 's supposed to be part of the thrill of staying in that room .
okay .
okay .
shall i show you the junior suite ?
first- yes , the- okay .
yes , the deluxe is a double bed .
it 's very pretty , is n't it ?
and you see you have your own wash basin here .
it 's like , you know , you are in your house .
so the fittings and everything are- it 's listed under budget but it 's not really budget .
i would n't call it % uh budget .
% uh when they 've opened it was fully booked for many months .
% hm it 's a very popular on the internet .
so your location would be chinatown .
yes .
that 's right .
so we gon na get you the rates now .
okay .
can you get it on the screen now ?
yes .
so it 's two hundred and ninety dollars .
they have- they have not mentioned any surcharge for easter weekend .
so it should be alri~ wait .
let 's have a look here .
peak period surcharge will be applied % uh , must be done in seven days , cancellation seven days prior to check-in .
so there might be a small surcharge because it 's the easter weekend .
% um , activities at the museum .
a lot of free activities you can enjoy , % uh but % um we- for here , for singapore , easter is mainly a religious festival and a public holiday .
% uh yes it 's solemn .
but you can visit for example- % uh are you catholic ?
so you can visit the catholic churches % uh for mass .
there are several churches in singapore .
% um , from where you are there are several catholic churches .
and the ones that many people go to is the cathedral of the good shepherd
and since you are there , you can also walk around and visit other churches , % uh within the area .
so let me get it for you .
the churches will be open .
% um , if the church is shut because there is no service , % uh you just go to the back , you know , where the priest lives and if you tell them you are tourist they might even bring you on a tour around the place .
yes .
% uh , at the cathedral here , we even have lunch time masses for people who go for daily mass during the lunch hour .
so this is a national monument and it is ones- just a few stops from % uh your hotel .
from chinatown .
yes .
% uh can you see here eighteen thirty-two ?
but of course it has been % uh repaired and % uh upgraded many times .
% uh many of the foreign community in singapore
% uh they come here because of its good location .
and you can see we even have a korean chaplin .
and we have many filipinas who help with the choir or , you know , with % um , collecting donations for the poor .
% uh , you see on the fourth sunday , we have a tagalog mass .
yes .
% uh for easter fo~ % uh you are staying for good friday , are you ?
is it good friday ?
yah , you can visit the churches in the daytime .
it 's not a problem .
and in this vicinity , we also have other churches .
let me try and get for you .
there 's the saint joseph 's church .
yes , i am catholic .
actually i was going to introduce you to my church % uh because i have a filipino choir .
but they sing on saturday .
so , you wo n't get to see them .
okay .
saint joseph 's church , let me see , huh ?
yes , % uh but i just , you know , back them up .
the filipinos do all the major singing .
all the solos .
many of our choirs , we have a large proportion of the filipino community in singapore that support the choirs .
yes .
yes , okay .
can you see this one ?
this is very pretty and it 's within walking distance of the cathedral .
% uh and here we 've got many statues inside and the way of the cross % uh along the walls .
% uh this church served to the eurasian community .
and- yes , this is prettier % uh and it 's an earlier church .
it was set-up by the portuguese mission that came but % uh after that the french mission took over % uh building of the churches .
yes .
and % uh there 's another one called saints peter and paul which is three minutes away from there .
all of these are national monuments .
they are protected .
so they will be here even if you come back fifty years later .
okay , let me see .
oh i should put in singapore .
let me see whether i get- saints peter and paul in singapore .
oh it 's not a problem .
the filipino choir do it all the time .
% uh , we often have get togethers and % uh somebody will donate some drinks for the party .
because % uh we take public transport , so they do n't have to worry about % uh , you know , driving after drinking .
so these churches i 'm showing you , they are within walking distance .
all three of them .
yes , very pretty .
saint- saints peter and paul .
% um , within this area we actually have the national museum .
okay .
okay .
% uh national museum , you may even get free entry because it 's a- if it 's a public holiday .
if it 's good friday you are here- % uh , you se- you- will you be here on good friday ?
the public holiday .
okay .
this is about ten minutes from % uh the churches .
okay .
walki~ yes .
so the location of where the churches are and where the museum is , it 's a old historic area .
% uh you just cross a few streets .
can you see victoria street ?
so the churches are victo~ just pass victoria- around victoria street , queen street .
you just cross these little roads and across the road
is the national museum .
so it 's very convenient for you .
% uh if- there are lots of places you can eat around there .
% um , you could go to raffles - what 's the food are you looking for ?
so % uh if you want to try new things without spending a lot of money , there is a food court just near to where the churches are .
and it 's along bras basah road .
% uh , i can not quite remember the name .
% uh the food court .
let me see if it 's called the republic foodcourt .
it 's a chain be- these food courts , they are chains .
just give us a moment .
okay , let me see .
no , the- it is not % uh republic .
it 's probably another one .
okay .
i 'm gon na try % uh , this other name .
yes , it 's in the same area .
% uh there you get a variety and you can see % uh , whether the food is suitable to you .
okay , can you see this ?
okay , the first one item on the list-
yah koufu .
it 's a chinese word .
yah .
it 's a chinese term .
and-
something to do with the mouth .
kou % uh is a mouth .
% uh at the fu , if it 's the correct fu is means the good luck of the mouth .
that means you are eating good food or delicious food at good prices .
i 'm just interpreting it .
i- they have a story about it but i do n't remember exactly .
okay .
so there you have it the explanation .
so you can tell if i 'm telling a lie .
'cause i remember is it really good fortune ?
so on the left what you are seeing is what we have for breakfast , a bun , two eggs , coffee or tea .
and then you can have % uh- you know dimsum ?
yah dimsum is to touch the heart and you can try- there is a stall that sells % uh , variety of food .
but at the food court it 's interesting this one you know where the cathedral is that i recommended that you visit ?
% uh is just opposite the cathedral .
% uh we have a university it 's called the smu and this is- this branch is at the basement of the smu .
is-
so you do n't have to be a university student to eat there .
i often eat there because the prices are reasonable and we even have the vietnamese stall , we have an indian stall % uh and we have a lots of chinese food .
vietnamese .
they % uh- the vietnamese do a very good rice roll , spring roll .
you know if you are into healthy foods , spring roll that is not fried but they use a special rice roll .
the roll- the wrapper is made of rice .
and so they have a lot of greens inside that , it 's very healthy .
% uh no , it 's not .
it 's like a spring roll except it does n't have a crispy exterior .
you know we believe that if you all eat all this fried foods , you get a sore throat ?
so when you think you are feeling % uh too much of the sun and you might get a sore throat , then you go for this kind of food .
it 's easier on the throat .
% hm yes .
there are- if you go to this food courts , you can try a whole variety of food without spending a lot of money .
lunch .
% uh better for lunch .
lunch there will be more stalls open .
% uh dinner time , i suggest you go a bit earlier because some stalls may close in the evening .
because the students would be there during the day time .
there is another food outlet that is % uh opposite this a little bit further down the road towards the museum but % uh opposite where this outlet is .
and that would be open late .
% uh , if you see- can you see bras basah here on the little map ?
so it 's along the same road is just stretching down a little bit .
% uh , and- okay .
yes , it 's the same location .
so- and so you could have your lunch at the smu .
i call it smu foodcourt because i identify it with the university .
% uh , can you see bras basah road ?
% uh where the number a- can you see the a there ?
yah , you can see the koufu foodcourt ?
if you go for the up the road towards prinsep street .
% uh but on the opposite side of bras basah road there is another food court there .
i ca n't remember the name but it 's one of a chain in singapore and you also get variety of food there .
so if you do the museum and then you want to have dinner nearby conveniently , that 's the place to go .
yes .
o~ okay .
% uh , quite near to here and you can walk if you like or if you are too tired % uh you can take may be two bus stops away is the singapore river .
so i 'm gon na suggest you go and walk along the river bank ,
you can have al fresco dining .
so i 'm trying to get it on the % uh screen for you .
% uh that means you are sitting outside the restaurant .
% uh if it 's too hot , you can move-in .
they usually have seating inside and outside .
yes .
% uh the sun is going down .
so it 's quite scenic .
% uh it depends on the day .
if it 's been a hot day , you will get % uh- you might find it a bit warm .
and then later in the evening , you might find its nice .
maybe at nine o'clock or ten o'clock .
okay .
hum .
i am not so up-to-date with music .
but , you can move along the various bars .
% uh some of them are sports bars that might interest you .
they have a big tv screen .
and if there is a match , like a football match , going on overseas people sit there and have drinks and watch the match .
okay .
% uh , you can start at boat quay and walk down towards clarke quay or you can visit the merlion by the singapore river .
okay , so-
no , the merlion is the emblem of singapore 's % uh tourism .
% uh the former emblem of the singapore tourism board .
it 's half lion head and half % uh fish
because we were a fishing village .
and a prince came along and thought he saw a lion .
so he asked- actually he asked what it was and he was told it 's a lion .
can you see it now ?
% uh it~
% uh , sentosa has a huge merlion about twelve stories high .
this is not so tall but it 's a favourite place for you to take photographs .
it 's % uh most tourists on their first visit would go there and % uh , photograph it .
can you see it ?
it 's on the screen now .
so while you at facing boat quay if you walk left you get to the merlion .
and so i think if it 's early enough , you might to want to take a photograph of the merlion first and then have your dinner along boat quay or clarke quay .
and-
yes , so it 's just one bus ride from , you know , the bras basah road i showed you just now where the food courts are ?
you take bus number one-three-one and you will reach there about fifteen or ten minutes .
% uh , the bus fare would be under a dollar for the two stops .
but remember , i said to buy a ezlink card .
so you top it up- maybe you put in more money and then you 'll get % uh bigger refunds .
so you do n't have to worry about topping up the value .
so short stops is under a dollar .
% uh longer stops may be up to a little over two dollars .
if you travel by train , it 's a bit more expensive .
% uh do you want to visit the zoo and the night safari ?
okay , i think you put in % uh maybe- put aside another twenty dollars to top it up .
it 's twelve dollars to buy the card .
okay .
% hm , no . twenty dollars , so about thirty .
but that 's more than enough .
you % uh-
it 's just so you do n't have to worry about
you know , % um- % uh topping it up .
% uh if you go to a seven eleven store which is open round the clock , you would be able to top-up your card .
but if you put more , you save time .
yah .
yes , that 's ri~
% uh then you can go the-
do you want to go to the zoo and the night safari ?
okay .
i 'll give you the website of wildlife reserves .
and i can show you pictures of three % uh parks that is run by this % uh company .
and i suggest you buy a package ticket so it is % uh cheaper for you for the entrance fees .
oh , no . the package is per person .
but , you can either choose to visit two parks or three parks .
but whatever you choose if you buy separately , say you entered the zoo and then next day you enter the bird park and you 're buying individual tickets , you are paying more .
so if you decide where you want to go and then you % uh , buy the ticket on your first visit , then you hold on to the ticket and on the next- at the next park you just present the same ticket .
% uh wildlife reserves , i am not sure .
normally the tickets are sold at the door .
but if you want to pay for your hotel in advance , i 'm very sure they 're very happy to take your money .
you can give them your credit card number and they will send you an e-mail confirmation .
so , you- at least for the hotel booking % uh which i think is very wise of you to book in advance .
yes .
unless you buy from a travel age~ and then-
you buying a whole-
yes ?
yes , i 'm here .
i 'm trying to get the pictures for you .
so see ?
we have a successful hornbill nesting % uh in the park .
and in fact we are releasing some of the hornbills into singapore
oh .
here you see the % uh-
aviary ?
and this is king of the skies show .
% uh here you can volunteer to take part in the show without paying extra .
% uh i should n't tell you , i take away the fun .
% ah okay .
king of the skies they ask you to participate .
and % uh you just put up your hand and if they select you then you go up there .
so there will be many people putting up their hands .
% uh so you may or may not be selected .
% uh not you i think .
% uh sometimes they do n't take very young children .
so the % uh trainers know what to do .
you can also % uh when you arrive get the % uh feeding time schedule .
and if you plan your visit to particular aviaries during feeding times , you can watch them being fed .
so in the african % uh aviary that you saw a minute ago , you can hold the bird seeds- actually they are worms .
you hold them in your hand and the birds will come and take the worms off your hands .
no , then the birds will eat up your tongue .
oh no . % uh i think not in singapore .
let me try and get you % uh , okay , the zoo .
yes , and it 's an open zoo % uh next to a reservoir .
so it 's very scenic .
i think % uh you would love it for its photography .
% uh the only new things you see is this .
it's- it 's a naked mole rat .
so it does n't have any hair .
bu~ i know you 're expecting something else .
okay .
% uh look .
can you see the great rift valley of ethiopia ?
can you see that on your screen ?
hello !
so you see this % uh creatures here ?
we got them from ethiopia and we have set-up an environment like they would live-in africa .
they are baboons .
oh no . % uh the only baboons are the human ones .
% uh these baboons -
the- % uh these baboons are- they have been replica~ there have been very successful breeding there so- so it 's a very large population .
and you are likely to see maybe a mother feeding a young .
% uh it's- the enclosure is glass .
so you 're fully protected .
yes .
oh yah .
it can be scary .
we have monkeys not baboons .
% uh monkeys that % uh that in the , you know , in the forest areas .
so we tell people not to feed them because we feed them then they expect food .
% uh you can eat with the orang-utans though .
can you see the middle one ?
the jungle breakfast with wildlife .
% uh you actually eat your own breakfast .
and the orang-utans at the back , the ones in brown they have a sort of open area where they can swing around and play in the trees .
but during breakfast time they come down and they have a buffet of fruits to eat .
and then after that you would be invited to take photographs with them .
no they do n't like our kind of junk food .
they have better food .
they have fruits .
they are more health conscious .
okay .
okay , the last one is the % uh river saf~ % uh sorry .
the night safari .
there 's also a river safari , you can take inside the zoo which is new .
but you might- be running out of time .
so let me show you the night safari .
% uh i 'm not sure if this is one but you know the giraffes that you see here ?
just had a baby giraffe born .
so it ' very interesting to see .
i ca n't promise that .
% um the- you will have to see the situation % uh when you get there because they take care of the young % uh- likely you can see because it will be with the mother if they do not put it aside % uh some place .
% uh you take a tram that looks a tiger at the back .
and you can see the- you can see these creatures in black and white ?
okay .
they are % uh malayan tapirs .
and they quite tame , so they roam around % uh the path of the trams .
they try and give way , but sometimes they forget the traffic rules .
yes , they are very tame .
but , you know , they wo n't listen to you if you tell them to get out of the way .
so if you 're on the tram ride and they are there , % uh it 's nicer .
because when you wait , then you have a chance to see better .
at night .
% uh , you can get in earlier to have your dinner .
so i 'm suggesting you go to the zoo in the afternoon .
and walk across their carpark to the night safari .
have a meal before the actual entrance to the park opens at seven thirty .
because that 's when we get night time .
% uh the keepers will put food near to where the lights are .
and that would be in an area where- as you are on the tram , you can get a very good view of them .
so you will be able to see them .
so you can not use your camera .
% uh firstly it disturbs the animals and then second you also disturb the other people on the tram ride .
so they do n't allow photography , % uh-
you can bring your camera , because in the outside area where there are no animals many people take photographs .
no , you ca n't because you spook the animals .
and- % uh you can see this show , the creatures of the night show .
it 's re- yes .
% uh it 's somebody who 's walking on a rope just above your heads .
so % uh again i 'm not gon na tell you .
you have to visit the zoo .
% uh actually i forget .
i forget what it is .
% uh , but you know , when you go there if you do n't want- you 're not comfortable with the animals right above your head , you just avoid the- overhanging % uh rope and you just go little bit further back and you can see it as it goes along .
okay , wait .
le~ % uh are you interested in the ticketing prices for this ?
first .
okay .
okay .
there you seeing some of the animals .
this is in the night safari .
these are beautiful , they are anteaters .
and antelopes .
yes , i 'm trying to get the prices for you .
wait , just a minute .
yah .
okay , sorry .
here it is .
% uh , so if you 're visiting all three you pay only fifty-eight dollars per person .
you see up here ?
if you 're visiting only the night safari , it 's thirty-two dollars .
yes , that 's right .
so-
yes .
a hundred sixteen actually , right ?
it 's fifty-eight per person .
yes , that 's right % hm .
yah .
e~ % uh if you 're at the zoo , you can eat at the zoo .
there are places to eat .
% uh or you can walk over to the night safari and you can either have a regular chinese meal or a buffet or you can have sandwiches , % uh burgers .
they have something called the bongo burger which is the name of an animal .
but there 's no bongo meat in it .
you just get a chicken or i think may be % uh fish .
i 'm not sure if it 's available .
but it 's just normal meat .
so do n't worry about eating wild animals there .
% hm it is- okay , you 're most welcome .
i hope to see you in singapore , dodie .
thank you .
nice talking to you .
bye .
bye .
hi , good afternoon .
this is tour guide- my name is lynnette and who am i speaking to ?
okay .
hi aaki .
and how may i- okay , i 'm fine .
and how may i help you today ?
sure .
if you are talking about this % uh year , % uh we have a period of time that coming up really soon end of may and december , because- then we have this great singapore sale .
so almost all the shops in singapore are having good discounts % uh for their shopping .
so that maybe one time that you 'd like to consider ?
the other period of time where we do have big celebration in singapore would be % uh hari raya % uh puasa .
so one month before % uh the date in august % uh we do light up the street in kampong glam as well as geylang serai .
% uh and you will find a lot of food that specially prepared to welcome hari raya puasa % um being % uh on sale at these two location .
so that is one other % uh month that you want to consider coming to singapore .
the other month would be in november and that 's where the indians get to celebrate deepavali and we light up serangoon road .
so % uh these ro- few roads that i mentioned % uh will gives you very good % uh photo opportunities because the streets are beautifully decorated % uh to remember or to celebrate these special days .
and of course in december we light up the whole street of orchard road right up to the marina area and again with a christmas theme .
so different months for you to choose .
so again depending on % uh what would you like and whether it fits into your schedule .
so % um most of these months is perfectly fine to come to singapore .
but if you ca n't fit in your schedule in those months then you can always % uh do it any other time % uh that you like .
okay , yah .
okay .
hari raya is a festival that celebrated by the malays here .
% um now in- % uh before hari raya the muslims would do % um a puasa that means they do not eat from % uh- yes , from % uh early morning % uh from dawn to dusk , alright .
so % uh after the % uh evening period that 's they can eat until day break again .
so after this % uh month of fasting or we called it puasa % uh the muslim will celebrate with this major festival called hari raya .
so-
yes .
% uh malay .
yah .
so these are festivals celebrated by the malay people .
so in order to celebrate this festival they will dress up their houses , clean up their houses .
not that they do n't clean the houses but they do very thorough cleaning of their houses as well as- % uh prepare their house for a visits by their relatives and friends .
so they would buy a food like for example special cookies that they may not eat for the rest of the year but specially made for the hari raya so that their friends % uh and relatives when they visit them can get to taste all the % um yummy cookies and food .
yes .
the % uh muslims will only do fasting before hari raya puasa , alright .
now once the- they have % uh completed their one month fasting , % uh they will celebrate hari raya .
yes , and of course they do % uh eat their normal meals .
and i 'm not saying that they do n't eat during the fasting season i 'm just saying that from day break to dusk they do not eat or drink .
but after they break their fast , everyday % uh in the evening usually at about seven plus in the evening .
% uh five plus , seven plus depending on the % uh moon % uh they will be able to eat .
and once day break they will % uh start to fast their fast again .
% uh august .
yes .
yes , the hari raya puasa is a public holiday in singapore .
% uh no , for the guides will be business as usual .
okay .
in november the % uh indians another race in singapore will be celebrating a major festival called deepavali and this is a festival of light .
% um again , same thing before the preparations for this festivals % uh the indians do not fast .
alright , they do n't have like % uh a fixed time for fasting .
so % uh they will start to prepare for this big celebration % uh by yearly thoroughly cleaning their houses , % uh making new curtains , making new cushions , buying new clothes for everyone to wear and of course again food plays a very important part in all our festivals .
so again preparing food % uh sweets % uh for their guests to enjoy when their guests , friends and relatives visit them during % uh the deepavali season .
well % uh the traditional clothes for the indians- because the indians come from the southern part of singapore .
% uh yes , so the southern indians would be wearing % um % uh sari .
alright , with- it 's a piece of cloth five point five metre without any zips or button % uh and it 's a matter of folding the cloth .
% uh it can come in any kind of materials from cotton right up to silk and the ladies would wear them with a short blouse .
so that would be the traditional costume for the south indian ladies .
but % uh a lot of the ladies here they do wear- the north indian ladies they wear this % uh salwar kameez which is % uh consist of a long blouse and long pants % uh with a scarf .
so- yes , that is also a traditional kind of a costume .
% uh but- yes , it is still % uh a normal every day kind of a dressing for our malay la~ % uh for our indian ladies here .
% uh but otherwise , most of the other time i would think that because of the % uh western- % uh modern influences well the indian ladies today would also be wearing the normal kind of % uh clothes that any other lady in the world would be wearing alright , the modern kind of dressing .
okay .
for the sari it 's actually a piece of material that is five point five metre long , alright .
% uh no , it 's for the ladies .
sorry ?
no , you are talking about sari , right ?
okay , sari is % uh worn % uh by the ladies .
the guys-
okay .
the guys will be wearing % um quite similar to what the % uh malay guys are wearing .
it will be % uh like a blo~ % uh a shirt with % uh long pants
okay .
sure no problem .
okay let me just-
yes ?
yes .
% uh park ?
% oh yes % uh- okay now- yes the image for the sari this is quite a modern % uh- yah version of the sari .
you can see now on the screen .
okay , let me just go-
okay .
yes .
you can see all these beautiful ladies wearing the traditional sari , alright .
% hm so they look very beautiful , right ?
very colourful .
yah very colourful sari .
it 's a piece of % uh cloth like i mentioned % uh there is no ti- % uh and there 's no zip or buttons on the sari the bottom part the skirt .
so it 's a matter of wrapping uh around the waist .
yah , and the ladies-
yah .
and the ladies wear them with a short % uh blouse .
yes so you see % um this-
% uh sorry ?
% uh well i would n't say they use these clothes but if you 're talking about the- wearing a traditional costume yes .
% uh quite a lot of our indian ladies today they would still try to wear traditional clothings especially when it comes to % um % uh major festivals % uh like % uh for example uh the deepavali .
yes they do try and wear % uh this kind of % uh costume .
yes .
well % uh deepavali is actually called the festival of light it 's because % uh the indians in their home they would like to light this % um incense and % uh a candle % uh in this incense- % uh candle holder in their home .
and basically in short , it 's actually a festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil .
% uh so this is all this festival is all about .
% uh up to the individual whether they want to use a scented or just a normal % uh kind of % uh candle .
yes .
alright .
% uh it 's quite a simple clothing .
okay .
after-
% uh no % uh special % uh well we can call it-
yah .
kurta .
kurta , k u r t a .
yah .
kurta .
kurta % um-
yah .
kurta , yah .
yah .
yah .
% uh for the indians in singapore % uh well i would say that majority of them would be % uh third generation singaporeans already .
so % uh even i think in their own home they would be speaking english but % uh a lot of the ancestors- the indian ancestors would come from % uh southern part of india % uh so yes they would be speaking tamil .
yes , the mother tongue for the indians % uh in singapore generally % uh tamil % uh unless they come from the northern part of singapore then they would be speaking hindi .
but incident-
yes .
but inci~
okay .
incidentally % uh tamil is one of our official languages out here in singapore .
% uh we do n't say dress % uh kurta is fine .
yah .
okay .
yah .
well % uh- yes .
the indians would visit % uh their relatives and friends and of course they get to % uh eat .
like i said the families would be busy cooking % uh % uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit they would have food available for them .
so % um they will be cooking things like curry different kind of % uh flavour of curry .
% uh eating this curry with rice or with % um % uh bread like % uh chapatti that 's made from wheat flour or roti prata .
% uh may~ but it maybe a little bit difficult to make this at home % uh or naan , alright .
naan is % uh of course the indian bread .
and the-
yah .
so these are % uh some of the foods that the indians % uh would be preparing .
% uh and of course a lot of homes they tends to make their own % uh so-called % uh sauces % uh and we call them masalas .
so they can make from coconut % uh they can make from beans , yellow beans , lentil .
% uh they can make them from % uh vegetables as well as spinach .
alright ?
so these are some of the dishes and food that the indians would prepare to welcome their friends and relative .
as to partying yah i think some of the younger people , yes they may go out partying in the various clubs that we have in singapore .
% uh so- but i think for deepavali the majority of the time they would like to spent time with their family % uh and visiting one another .
% uh okay .
i % uh mentioned that actually all the time they would be eating % uh a lot of this bread like roti prata , chapatti , naan with curry .
so again this is one food that they will % uh be % uh having that a lot of them also like to eat this food called % uh tandoori .
okay , i 'm gon na show you some % uh % uh show you a picture of this tandoori .
it is a chicken that is cooked with a spice , alright .
and a red colour % uh colouring .
so that is the tandoori .
% uh it can be a plain rice .
% uh i 'm talking about the chicken huh .
so th~
yah .
so this is % uh usually it 's quite red in colour , the tandoori % uh chicken .
yah .
% uh not special , it 's the way that it 's cooked % uh that is special .
they put this chicken % um and cook them in % uh this big % uh kind of a clay pot % uh .
so that is-
yah .
yes .
yes .
% uh okay , hold on .
i 'll get another recipe out here .
let see .
yah .
yes .
but if- they do- % um yah but- you see- % uh if they do not have time they can always buy them % uh from the hote~ % uh from the restaurants or buy them from cafes .
% uh so these are just very i would say typical % uh indian dishes that indians would prepare either at home or they buy them % uh from the % uh restaurant .
now and the indians- yes they do eat % uh a lot of this food .
they eat % uh basmati rice which is the longer kind of rice grain .
yah .
so they would be % uh eating this rather from- % uh rather than rice that comes from thailand alright , which is the shorter rice grain .
so this is the kind of % uh- just some examples of % uh indian food that we have , okay .
and then of course % um a lot of families do prepare masalas .
% uh like i said those are sauces and they come in like white colour , green colour , orange colour because they are made from different kind of ingredients .
the yellow colour masalas would be made from beans .
yes .
yes .
% uh this will be the celebration for christmas .
well in singapore whatever races or % uh belief % uh that we come from % uh everybody else i think celebrate christmas here in singapore because the streets in orchard road % uh will be lighted up very beautifully .
so i 'm just going to show you % uh last year % uh the light up on orchard road .
okay .
well you can walk .
yah .
% uh no , not from the airport , alright ?
% uh what i meant by walking is well you can stay anywhere in singapore .
so you just go the orchard road and-
i would n't say the % uh main city .
% uh it is like the main % uh shopping belt in singapore .
so % uh now you have this image of last year , the whole street of orchard road is lighted up .
so that 's why i say you walk and you % um enjoy the lights and lots of bus- % uh photo opportunities .
alright , beautiful lightings because every year the lights are % uh different .
the decorations on the buildings , on orchard road because every other building on orchard road is either a hotel or a shopping complex .
so % uh they are also nicely decorated for christmas so of course with-
if you mean participate by coming down to orchard road , do a little bit of shopping and % uh soaking in the atmosphere % uh and taking photograph then yes .
% uh that- then that is participation .
yes it 's very pretty in the month of december .
% uh yes , we do have .
% uh on the christmas day % uh christmas eve we- what we do is you see now a lot of cars on the street ?
what we do is we close this street .
yes , i'm-
yes .
so and % uh- yes we have a street party out here .
alright ?
inside just-
eight p.m .
eight p.m . until % uh twelve midnight .
% uh in fact we just close this street % uh just over the last weekend .
we had the fashion % uh step out % uh fashion .
so we have the longest runway , alright .
the models are modelling on the street .
okay so- well something- this is the first time that we are doing it fashion step out .
okay , yah .
% uh no . orchard road is one % uh long street of shopping % uh opportunities .
so- okay .
orchard road itself is about % uh three kilometres long .
so every other building would be a shopping mall or hotel .
in fact- okay .
we do n't have % uh three star hotel in orchard road we do have four star .
% uh just about ten minutes ' walk we have this hotel called elizabeth hotel .
yah .
it 's a small hotel .
okay , let me just show you .
yah .
this is-
okay , you can choose this hotel .
the rates wise for this hotel is approximately about two hundred and fifty dollars , this is one option .
% uh because you're- if you 're going to just stay a short % uh stay in singapore % uh no problem , alright .
so you can stay in this hotel .
% uh the other hotel just next door to this hotel is this hotel called york hotel .
because % uh i 'm just % uh choosing some hotels just very close to orchard road since you know , i think you may decide to come in the month of % uh december .
so you know you just walk down to the are- the street that is all lighted up , okay to visit york hotel .
the charges approximately % uh two hundred and eighty dollars per room per night .
so this is another option .
% uh otherwise you could stay in this hotel called grand park hotel city hall .
you could also choose to stay here as well .
differences as in location ?
okay .
% uh all the three hotels they have full amenities so they have breakfast available in the morning .
% uh they have % uh % um cafes in the hotel .
so if you do n't want to eat out you can always eat inside the hotel .
you could have room service as well in these three hotels .
now if you want a little bit more affordable you can stay in this hotel called % um grand central .
that is also just a five minutes ' walk % uh from the % uh orchard belt area .
% uh grand cen~
% uh no . % uh for all our hotels we do n't have % uh shows in the hotel itself because they do n't have % uh like concert theatre .
so if you want to attend any concerts , yes we do have big acts coming in to singapore .
% uh so again i have to- i will have to check for you in december what are the big acts that 's coming to singapore .
% uh the only theatre we have in singapore would be at the esplanade .
well it 's just one station or two station away % uh from orchard road .
so it 's the esplanade , alright ?
% uh this is our theatre so we can see % uh what are the acts that will be coming what are the acts or musical that is in town % uh-
yah .
so we will have to check % uh for the month of december , okay .
we will check .
yes , you would have to ride a mrt .
% uh okay , that 's the short way- % uh subway to come to the esplanade theatre .
so this is one of the main theatres that we have .
% uh like i said % uh every month , every other week we have % uh act that is % uh playing % uh in singapore whether it 's a recital from classical right up to % uh rock singer , celebrity musical .
yah we do have this big act coming to singapore .
yes , this is the entertainment % uh area in singapore .
so well we will check what is coming in the month of % uh december .
yes , we do have big acts coming to singapore and i think olivia newton-john is coming .
if i 'm not-
yes .
but in december i will have to check for you % uh who is- % uh what are the acts that 's coming in december .
so like i mentioned a lot of different kind of show % uh that we have % uh here .
sorry ?
the past show ?
last month ?
yes .
can easily find that out .
yes , you can see all these other show .
% uh okay , that 's in april .
so you- we wanted to know the past month in february .
that is still in april .
you have seen this show ?
yes .
so it 's almost every other week .
right , a lot of shows .
so it 's like every other week there is some show going on .
yes .
yes .
it 's a mix .
yah , we have-
it all depends .
% uh so we basically have the whole calendar so we could check you know like if you are planning to come in december what acts is coming and then you could coincide your % uh arrival time with what you 're going to watch .
and you could always book % uh tickets online % uh for the acts that you want to see .
okay so for the month of march we have quite a lot of the % uh-
yah .
yes % uh musical .
yes we do have like i said % uh even pop music and all that , yes we do have .
but yah- i think in the month of march % uh we have more on the classical music side .
okay , but i can recommend you something % uh that you do n't have to pay because every week friday night and saturday night % um at the amphitheatre just outside this esplanade % uh which is at the marina bay % uh we have free concerts .
free concert , yes .
so it 's an open-air stage and you can go and watch .
and normally the concert comes on % uh at eight o'clock in the night time .
% uh yes .
it 's % uh it 's a free % uh free show .
yah .
so you can % uh i mean if you do n't want to spend % uh just an easy night out % uh just want to see and have some music then % uh we have always free concerts and well any time .
and if you think there is something that 's interesting to you yah you can just pop by , alright or you just have a dinner around the area % um and you can just pop by for the free concert .
ant it 's on- yes .
so you do n't have to spend money , right ?
and you could % uh spend more on your hotel .
yes .
so because you are thinking of coming in december so i think % uh those will be good locations for you to stay .
you just walk out and well yah in this musical % uh magical street .
yes , that 's right .

so you are asking me where is the marina- % uh the esplanade is just here where you- at the bottom right hand corner on the opposite side of these three tower this is marina bay sands resort .
so across the street that would be the % uh esplanade .
alright , it looks like two porcupine .

and % uh % um other days then everybody has play- pay the cover charge and the cover charge will increase- will include a first drink house pour .
okay .
% uh it will be just % uh finger food for this % uh clubs .
finger food meaning % uh we would probably serve you % um % uh things like chicken wing , fried chicken wings , % uh french fries or maybe just a deep fried spring -
% um yes .
some of our fast food would not have this kind of food so it 's basically finger food that they 'll be serving in the club % uh not like main courses .
okay .
yah , that 's right .
so let see whether are there any events .
okay for the period of march yes they 're having this % uh the indie disco club .
yah .
yes .
so this is the event for march .
you like indie disco ?
okay .
okay , good .
so you have a lot of options .
so i 'm just giving you two options since you said that you do n't want to get too far away from the marina bay sands area .
welcome .
okay , yes ?
okay .
so next month in april they are having this event % um-
yes .
so they have different i~
yah .
yah .
yes , okay .
so these are all the different events that they are having and yes they do update quite diligently % uh their website .
nearer the marina bay , okay we have another club % uh called insomnia .
you could sleep ?
i do n't think you can sleep in here .
because there are too many things to do out here .
okay .
yes and like i 've said you said that you do n't want to get too far away so i 'm just % uh choosing these clubs that is nearer to % um where you 're going to stay .
yah .
yah , this is the- yup .
yes .
yah .
so this is another one , another location which is about from the marina bay sands approximately about % uh ten minutes ' walk to the % uh city hall % um yah it 's about twenty minutes .
yes .
yah .
about % uh-
yah .
because % uh we have to take into account how much you want to spent in singapore , right ?
so if you 're going to spend a little bit more on the hotel well then you can do a little bit of walking .
it 's not that far away .
the closest mrt is city hall so what- from marina bay you could actually take the mrt and % uh stop at city hall .
alright .
it 's just about one , two bus stop- % uh two- one , two stations away .
two stations away % uh or one and a half stations away from % uh the marina bay .
and you will be walking- % uh there is actually % um air-conditioned underpass all the way the way from the marina bay sands right up to raffles place and from raffles place mrt one station to city hall .
% uh it is-
okay .
if you see the place-
okay .
so i think i've- have i given you a lot of things to do in singapore for your short stay ?
yah just to party , right ?
okay .
yah .
yes .
okay , so we-
sure , just give me a call again .
alright .
okay , thank you .
okay , thank you very much for calling .
bye .
good afternoon .
this is tour guide one .
and this is lynnette speaking .
can i get your name please ?
% uh so do i call you romeo don ?
don romeo , alright .
okay , not romeo and juliet huh ?
okay , don jum- % uh romeo how can i help you today ?
% uh for any celebrations ?
oh , okay .
alright .
well , i would give you % uh maybe a very romantic place % uh for proposal .
okay , i 'd like to introduce you to this place called jewel box .
yah .
romantic right ?
well , it 's actually a dining in % uh right on top of mt . faber .
so , it 's one of the romantic place yah .
you can see this is- yah
right , okay .
well , we do n't have mountains in singapore .
we only have hills .
we have- if you are talking of % uh on top then mount- % uh bukit timah hill .
% um but usually it's- there will be people outside on % uh bukit timah hill .
% hm % uh maybe like % uh some of our % uh beach front area .
okay .
yes , % uh- well , this is not really a beach .
i 'm just going to show you these images of this park .
it 's called % uh labrador park .
okay . this is still very romantic as well .
okay . this is still very romantic as well .
okay .
you know , you can see this is actually a - and bridegroom taking photographs on the labrador park .
it 's pretty quiet in the night time .
you can see the beautiful scenery .
yah , so this is the labrador park out here .
of course there ' s a little bit of history .
you can see that- and again the wedding couple taking photographs .
yah so this is quite a romantic spot % uh for a proposal .
so , there are quite a fews % uh spots .
yes and this is the view of the night time sunset .
okay , so this is-
okay , this is just one of the places that you can consider uh for a proposal .
okay and it 's not that crowded .
alright , in the evening there would be some people around , but uh like i said it 's not that crowded .
alright , it 's just % uh there will be just a bit- a few people out there .
yah , but anyway it 's a safe place .
and with them a few people around .
% um ya i think that 's nice as well .
okay ?
so , this is % uh one of the location that you may want to consider .
% um otherwise , we have lots of other parks .
% uh somewhere this one nearer to the % uh botanical gardens .
sure % uh- okay .
then i will propose- okay , maybe you have to look at this botanical garden .
so , you can see there 's so many beautiful spots where you can do your proposal .
alright ?
it 's very % uh- and it 's not crowded .
again because it 's big enough for you to choose your % uh favourite % uh place where she likes .
and you can now do the proposal out there .
okay , the more closest to the botanical gardens would be the tanglin mall .
okay .
% um , yes .
let me just show you the tanglin mall .
okay , this is the tanglin mall .
it 's just at the end of the orchard belt area .
and the botanical garden is just diagonally across .
so you can take her to this mall first .
but this is not % uh- this mall is not as big as the other malls in singapore .
alright .
so , you just want to do with just % uh a quick spot of % uh shopping before you go to the gardens .
alright .
okay , so you could have a meal out there as well there are restaurants option % uh in the tanglin mall .
and like i 've said you just walked across- diagonally across .
% uh that would be about ten minutes ' walk .
and you will be at the % uh main gate of the botanical gardens .
so , you can just walk and % uh have a nice stroll in the garden .
and the garden closes its door at twelve midnight .
labrador park .
yah so , you are % uh going to do your proposal in the botanical gardens .
alright .
now , from here you are actually down in orchard road .
% uh so again if you just walk % uh just the- from the tanglin mall , you just walk down .
% uh you will come to orchard road .
% uh and over that way that is actually a shopping or- % um hotel right next to one another .
so , this is actually one of the street scene along the orchard % uh- or tanglin shopping centre area .
oh yah .
this photo was taken during the christmas season .
% uh yah .
but it 's a quite % uh old % uh photograph already .
yah .
% uh you can make it here the next- the coming christmas in december .
% uh well , it depends on where you want to stay .
% uh around this area because this is actually at the other end of the orchard road .
so , it- there are few hotels here .
% um we have the traders hotel .
it 's just next door to this mall .
the tanglin- yah , i mean if you are talking about you do n't want to walk too far .
there 's a traders hotel .
okay . i think this is quite a good choice % uh hotel .
okay . i think this is quite a good choice % uh hotel .
% um but like i said any other hotel along orchard road .
since this is going to be your proposal trip .
then , i will propose that % uh stay in a nicer hotel .
so , any other hotel on the street itself % uh would be a relatively % uh good hotel .
% um we have right smacked in the heart of % uh the orchard hotel .
we have % uh a relative new hotel by the name of % uh grand park orchard .
yes .
let me just- okay .
this is orchard grand park .
this is orchard grand park hotel .
and you 're right smack % uh you can see this is the map of orchard .
okay , this is one straight road .
% um the earlier hotels i proposed to you is on this side .
on the left-hand side .
and grand park will be right smacked in orchard road .
% uh , yup .
it 's about % uh just a leisurely walk about twenty minutes and you 'll be in the park .
bus .
alright .
and % uh you will be alighting at the fourth bus stop .
% uh bus number seventy-five .
% um , yes .
yes , i mean i think they are % uh suitable % uh for a couple- % uh to have a nice time in singapore .
and % uh maybe you may want to do some % uh body massage in singapore .
the spa , you know % uh in singapore .
so , we do have spa treatment .
okay , so- okay , these are just some of the option % uh that we have and- well , there are nice places with very % uh relaxing spa in singapore .
for example , you can % uh do the one at raffles city .
% uh okay .
% uh this is in sentosa
yah .
it 's % uh one of our offshore % uh resort island .
but anyway , there are also nice spa on the mainland itself .
so , you can always have- give her % uh a pamper , you know .
pamper her with % uh a spa treatment .
okay .
so , not that she has to decide whether to marry you or not % eh . okay , so- yah , nearby to grand park -
yes grand park they do have this service as well .
% um otherwise , you can have your- this % uh spa treatment in another hotel like for example hyatt % uh fairmont hotel .
% uh they have all these % uh spa treatment
% uh yes .
they can % uh provide this service .
alright .
% uh why do n't you do- why do n't you give her the spa treatment in the afternoon ?
then , you could go to the garden .
so , your proposal in the night time .
and either you give her a nice dinner treat first % uh before the proposal .
yah .
so , what you can do is we have this % uh very interesting- or i would say % uh dinner place in the botanical garden .
% uh which are then at the botanical gardens .
i 'm gon na show you some images .
then , you can have your dinner here .
and later just go for a stroll in the garden .
yah .
so , you could do this option .
alright .
you can see .
it will be- yah .
it will be western food in this % uh restaurant in a colonial house .
yah .
this is that your- this % uh restaurant is built in the garden .
alright ?
so , % ah- so , again very relaxing .
so , both of you will be in a relaxed mood .
% um enjoy a dinner in the garden .
and then go for a stroll .
okay .
okay .
sure .
no problem .
then in that case , you just get out of the traders hotel .
you just go % um next door to the shopping mall .
okay .
then you have to % uh travel a little bit .
alright ?
% um you go this placed called dempsey .
okay .
now , this is just about- it will be a little bit inconvenient- % uh because there is no mrt ride that 's so close to the little hill up here .
% uh so , you may have to take a taxi .
alright , from % uh orchard road .
% uh it 's just about a ten minutes ' ride .
okay .
from the traders hotel , you will walk about twenty-five minutes .
yah .
if you want walk .
% um so there are quite a few dinner options out here .
% uh ranging from indian food to chinese food .
of course western again % um-
% uh a lots of option % um- yes .
% uh chili crab in our chinese restaurant .
% um indian food % uh like curries .
a lot of curries
so , good- well , one of our very popular food in % uh singapore would be chili crab , pepper crab .
% uh but it 's not- you do n't really want to eat with your hands .
i mean sorry , you will eat with your hands .
rather than eating with your spoo~ % uh fork and % uh knife .
s~
yah .
it 's alright .
it 's perfectly fine when you eat crabs using your hands .
it 's acceptable % uh etiquette % uh out here in singapore .
okay .
now , % um- so , this is- we 're quite famous now .
% uh lot of people come here .
and it 's one of the must do in singapore % uh having this % uh crab .
it 's a bit spicy though i must warn you first .
okay .
if you want something a little bit % uh not so exotic .
we are also very famous % uh for chicken rice .
yah .
okay .
this is chicken rice .
yes .
the chicken rice is the rice is cooked with the chicken stock .
% uh , so it 's very tasty and- well , it 's also one of our favourite food out here .
chicken rice .
okay .
and % uh-
% uh , okay .
and of course % uh satay .
okay .
this is satay .
it 's marinated meat .
you can have chicken % uh mutton .
lamb .
% uh and of course if you buy them from the chinese store .
then you 'd be able to get pork satay .
but if you buy them from the % uh malay store owner , they wo n't sell pork satay .
% uh so this is marinated meat pierced through a skewer , the garnishes .
% uh would be onions and cucumber .
and you can order a side dish of the rice % uh ketupat .
this is rice % uh cooked in % uh leaf .
a packet % uh- leaf packet , alright .
and this is actually almost a complete meal already .
you have your meat , you have your vegetables and you have rice .
it looks yummy , right ?
okay .
so , you can have that - % oh if you want to have your dinner in another place .
you can choose to go to one fullerton .
okay .
there 's where you can have your chili crabs here as well .
alright .
they serve chili crab at one fullerton % uh .
okay .
and it 's romantic as well .
you 'll be dining along the marina bay with the merlion in the background .
% um , so that 's very % uh romantic as well in the night time .
% um , well i would think that dempsey would be % uh just % uh off orchard road .
% uh , you will have to walk if you really want to walk .
it 's about twenty-five minutes .
and it 's a little bit up slope and down slope .
so , maybe not so conducive if you are talking about % um- later on you 're going to do a proposal .
so , maybe this would be a better choice .
% um and if you again do n't want to go too far away , you can just walk back on the % uh one fullerton .
% uh just a very slow walk % uh through a three miles of % uh esplanade area .
and you can even do your proposal at the esplanade .
yah .
yah .
so , you can walk back , you know .
remember just now you saw the bay .
okay .
so , you just walk back a little bit % uh on the three % uh line and you 're still walking on the bay .
so , it 's a nice % uh evening stroll out here .
and again % uh they are not so crowded .
you can always find a spot again to do your proposal if you want to do it .
by the bay or go back to the botanical gardens and do your proposal out there .
% uh , yah .
yah , because this is very iconic .
% uh the local would like to call this- it looks like % um the porcupine .
yah . it looks like porcupine , right ?
yah . it looks like porcupine , right ?
there are two of them .
% uh well , the local like to call this the durian .
which you have this fruit back home as well .
this is- one of them is a theatre and the other one is % um a concert hall .
so , yes only singapore have these % uh two % uh buildings out here .
so , you can just do your proposal anywhere along the marina bay .
and in the night time , it looks really nice .
see how lighted up it is .
okay .
yah .
i know there 's a lightning .
yes , it 's actually a nice spot as well .
but at least you can always have the crab at the one fullerton .
and you just take a very short % uh walk along the marina bay % uh along the esplanade area .
and you come to the esplanade .
so , a really slow takes you about % uh fifteen minutes .
very slow .
yah .
yah , it sounds good .
but we do n't call it porcupine .
we called it the esplanade .
yah .
esplanade theatres by the bay .
% um , yes . so , maybe the % uh morning % uh botanical gardens .
% um , yes . so , maybe the % uh morning % uh botanical gardens .
% uh i think you should do it in the morning when it 's not so hot .
yah , so- because the park opens as early as five .
so- but if you are getting up % uh a bit later is still fine .
but % uh maybe by eleven o'clock , you should leave the botanical gardens .
because it 's starting to get a little bit warm in the afternoon .
% uh % hm , okay .
we have the dry day today .
% uh temperature-wise it 's % uh- well , throughout the whole year it does n't change very much .
% um , approximately in the mid-afternoon about thirty-two degrees - thirty to thirty-three - two degrees .
% uh november , december possibly about thirty degrees in the mid-afternoon .
morning , evening right up to about nine a.m . in the morning .
it would be in the temperature range of about twenty-six degrees .
and slowly rising up to thirty degrees .
well , if she accepts your proposal , then of course you can do a bit of sightseeing in singapore .
right ?
so , you could do a little bit of the % uh what do you called that ?
the photo spot to have % uh some good memories of singapore .
so , again if you just go back- % uh , okay i would say that you would probably have some photograph taken in the night time of the bay .
as well as the merlion .
alright , the merlion that is facing the bay .
okay .
let 's scroll down again .
and see whether we get the merlion .
yes .
okay .
and can see the merlion out here ?
okay , so you- so , you would probably be getting some spot .
so , the next day you do n't have to come back to the marina bay .
so , what you do is % um you can go to our ethnic areas .
% uh like-
okay .
you can go to a place called % uh kampong glam .
okay .
just give me moment .
yes .
so , that-
well you can go to this place .
the food as well .
okay .
and this you can try again some % uh malay cuisine , indian cuisine , arabic , egyptian cuisine , turkish cuisine .
they can be found in this area called kampong glam .
alright .
now , % uh this street is called haji lane .
it 's quite a big street .
because the shops are owned by pretty young entrepreneurs .
and the kind of products they carry % uh would be one of its kind .
so , you do n't find them in % uh our shopping mall .
so , they basically have just one shop .
if , you know you are not into shopping .
your girlfriend not really into shopping .
it 's also a very nice % uh way to just soak in a little bit of the atmosphere out here .
% uh and just have the feel of these quaint % uh shops .
and you can see this particular street is quite narrow .
so , this is haji lane over in kampong glam .
alright . you could always stop-
alright . you could always stop- kampong glam .
k a m p o n g. next word glam g l a m. so , you could do a spot of like window shopping .
% uh and % uh this is an area where we allow some graffiti .
% uh to be done to the walls % uh in kampong glam .
okay .
so , she likes some quirky fashion , you know not the run of the mill fashion .
yes , i 'm sure she should be able to pick up something % uh from this lane .
% um , you could also enjoy a sport of % um shisha .
it 's a water pipe .
yes .
um-
okay .
this is- okay .
this is kampong glam here .
let see whether we get any picture of these water pipes .
it 's % um-
well , % um singapore is not that big .
alright .
% uh it 's accessible from the mrt or the buses .
so , it 's not like- well , i- i do n't encourage you to walk from orchard road to kampong glam .
yes , that 's right .
the mrt % uh- the stop that you 're going to alight would be at the bugis mrt .
okay .
so , let see-
yah , we have % uh -
okay , % uh yah i ca n't find any % uh images of the % uh water pipes .
% oh you could also do-
yes .
flavoured water .
it 's a bit of like smoking .
but % uh instead of % uh the normal way of smoking .
it 's filled with flavoured water .
yes .
it 's actually smoking flavoured water .
% uh what ?
sport ?
over here ?
% uh no . okay , but now i 'm showing you some photograph of what people- % um , this is called shisha .
yah , so- no , you are not- nowhere near waters at all .
in the past , yes kampong glam was right next to the water .
but not today .
okay .
so , this is the % uh water pipes and that 's % uh available % uh at the kampong glam area .
okay .
so , a picture % uh says a thousand words , yah .
so , this is the- what % uh shisha is all about .
okay .
so , it 's something different alright from what you would % uh be able to see or do % um back home .
so , this is one of them .
% uh otherwise , you can always stop for % um a coffee % uh or tea % uh with some snacks .
% um like curry puff .
okay .
okay , alright .
so you can do this % uh sightseeing over in kampong glam area .
you can spend about % uh one hour just to walk around .
% um and also- okay , but the muslims they do not % uh buy % uh the normal perfumes from the normal % uh kind of the perfume shops .
so , what they do is they buy perfumes .
% uh from this kind of shop they concord their own perfume .
% uh and they do not contain alcohol .
so- yes .
okay , this is % uh perfume shops in kampong glam .
so , you are asking me about some sightseeing .
so , this is-
you see all the colourful bottles that you can get from kampong glam .
and you can fill them up with perfume .
% uh beautiful fabrics in case she wants to % uh tailor some clothes from these beautiful fabrics .
alright .
so , this is % uh some sightseeing along with a little bit of shopping .
and there 's the houses in kampong glam very historical .
more than one hundred years old .
this is arab street .
traditionally , there was- this was where a lot of the arabs used to live .
and in fact , a lot of the shop owners here are third generation arabs .
okay .
so , this is a bit of % uh sightseeing cum a little bit of shopping for ethnic products .
example , you can take the mrt again from bugis .
change station at dhoby ghaut mrt train station .
and proceed on to little india .
so , you will get to see the other ethnic area % uh in little india .
lindia- india .
okay .
again , very colourful as well .
% uh indian temple out here .
colourful flowers , garlands .
alright .
% uh light up during the deepavali season in the month of november .
so , this is little india .
so , you have a little bit of cultural aspect .
a bit of sightseeing .
% uh the architecture and notice there are two-storey not three-storey .
so , a little bit of that .
% uh i would suggest that for ethnic area .
it is better to do them in the day time .
because there are more activities going on .
and of course if you just walk around the esplanade area .
you will see % uh this building .
that actually looks like a spaceship .
it 's our supreme court .
okay .
yah , so you can do a sport of % uh sightseeing around the bay area .
just about ten minutes ' walk .
so , you get to see the historical area .
for example , this green dome building .
now , it 's undergoing restoration .
this used to be our old supreme court .
and % um-
okay .
and this building now that looks like- i like to call it the spaceship building .
this is our- it 's supreme court .
okay .
% uh this one that have this- yes .
yah , you called it a plate .
i called it a spaceship .
okay .
so , this is the new supreme court .
okay .
it 's nice .
you know , if you compare the old- new architecture the old architecture .
% um and around the- this greenfield you have of course % uh the colonial buildings of singapore .
so , that 's a little bit of % uh sightseeing out here .
and again you 'll be looking at- you will also-
okay .
you are- you will also be passing by some of these other historical areas .
like % uh the parliament house .
okay .
it 's all within the vinicity of this rectangular % uh greenfield .
yes .
% uh visit as in passing by or going into the building ?
this one .
okay .
this one is parliament house .
% uh if you want to visit , we- i would suggest by the side of the parliament house .
we have a gallery .
you can- if you want to visit .
yes , you can do that .
yah .
% uh if there is no parliament sitting , % uh- no , then there will be no entry % uh into the parliament house .
so , there 's a little bit of % uh restriction going into the parliament house .
otherwise , the one that i showed you just now the % uh supreme court .
yes , you are allowed to enter into the supreme court subject to the security checks .
% uh that we will require anyone who needs to enter into the supreme court .
yap .
okay .
yes , i agree .
but- yes .
yah .
so , you can do a ride on this boat .
we called it the singapore % uh cruises .
and this boat plies on the singapore river .
it is a half an hour ride .
% uh that would cost you fifteen dollars for an adult .
% uh it 's very relaxing .
you know , you can do your walk around the next day - second day , alright .
do a walk and then- but if you 're a little bit tired , you can just go on to this boat ride .
% um and there would be % uh english commentary on the boat .
so , you could do this % uh boat ride on the singapore river .
because the river is very historical .
% um and that 's how singapore get rich in the early days .
because this was our port .
so , % uh- yes , on the boat you will get to have an idea how people used to live along the river .
and these boats in the past used to ferry goods .
but the boats are slightly smaller in the past .
% um and right now % uh these boats are run on electricity .
in the past , they will run on diesel .
okay .
so , that is a relaxing ride on the singapore river .
okay .
it does n't make a difference .
i would suggest that in the morning you walk around the % uh padang area .
where you see all the historical buildings .
now , take a two hours walk at- or three hours walk , you know if some of the buildings you may want to go inside .
and in the af~ % uh have % uh a break for lunch in the surrounding area .
either you % uh break at the raffles place .
there are some small bistro out there .
% uh or you can go to high street again .
it 's just about a five minutes ' walk % uh from the parliament house .
% uh there is a food court there .
that served all the street food . and aboard % uh river cruise , % um-
that served all the street food . and aboard % uh river cruise , % um- % uh on the singapore river .
alright .
and the boat will again bring you all the way out to the marina bay .
and you get to see the merlion % uh from a different angle .
alright .
the first night , you are on the edge of the marina - % uh of the merlion .
now , if you take this boat you are looking at the merlion from the waters .
okay .
so , that you can do in the afternoon , late morning .
it 's fine .
% uh then you could have a spot of % um lunch - alright , a leisurely lunch .
and take a rest in the % uh hotel before you do another night spot again .
okay .
so , after your boat cruise % uh what you could do is you bring her back to the- again , if you do n't want to go too far away from where you are .
you could just do a very small area .
then , you go to the shopping centre called % uh raffles city .
yes .
alright .
so , raffles city % uh they are like five- four lev~ % uh five level , two basement area .
% uh where she can do her shopping .
branded stuff mid-range .
and if that is not enough still she can go to the underground .
and do % uh some serious shopping again .
the underground city mall - % uh citylink will be just mid-range products .
and if again that 's not enough , by the time she goes through the underground city ma~ % uh , okay this is a picture of the raffles city .
by the time she walked over to another shopping mall called marina square .
so , yes she can really shop 'til she drop .
do n't worry .
our shops here we accept plastic cards .
okay .
so , she can do % uh spot of % uh serious shopping again in the marina % um % uh square .
alright .
okay .
so , you must remember to buy her a big diamond ring then .
alright .
okay .
so , that 's a lots of shopping % uh options % uh available .
and again if you do n't want to get too far away- but if you want to see a little bit more , then of course you can always go back to the orchard road .
% um % uh for her shopping % uh requirements .
yes .
okay .
% oh for food is it ?
sweet and romantic and yet local .
so , are you going to have it in them- in the restaurant or in the % uh hawker centre at the non-air-conditioned food place ?
okay .
% uh sweet , okay .
i mean like main courses generally they will not be sweet .
% um but something that is very unique and i do n't think you get that in % um % uh philippines .
% uh remember the satay that i showed you ?
okay .
so , % uh you could do that .
% uh do you still need me to show you the photographs of satay ?
okay .
so , you can have that .
yes , it 's a little bit % uh sweet .
% uh otherwise , one of our % uh very popular dish % uh would be this % uh fried noodles - hokkien fried noodle .
yah .
so , this is the % uh something which is quite unique % uh in singapore .
it 's cooked with a little bit of seafood .
alright .
yes .
and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana % uh leaf at the bottom .
and then you can see there 's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour .
of course , the chili will be a little hot .
% um yah , something a little bit unique out here % uh in singapore .
hokkien mee .
yah .
alright .
otherwise , if you still would like to do a little bit of sightseeing .
then , maybe i could recommend that you go to the night safari .
yah .
okay .
yes .
% uh all the restaurant .
chinese restaurant would be able to serve you these dishes .
it 's quite a common % uh food % uh that a lot of the locals like to eat .
% um then you can all- % um you could have like % uh early dinner .
and then proceed on to the northern part of singapore .
% uh by taking the train and the bus and you will arrive in the night safari park .
because the park only opens in the night time .
the park opens at seven-thirty in the evening .
and it closes its door at twelve midnight .
well , it is enough .
if you have two and a half hours to spend inside the park .
% uh it is more than enough time for you to enjoy the park .
% uh yes .
it 's quite a big park .
% um and what you will do is you would go on the tram ride .
if you see this % uh picture over here on the left-hand side .
now , this is a tram ride .
so , you get onto this tram .
the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes .
but if you make a stop midway and you walked % uh the leopard 's trail .
% uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail .
and when you finished the trail , you come back to the tram station .
and you board the next tram back to the entrance .
and if you still are energetic enough , you can still do another walking trail .
alright .
% uh because on the tram itself you actually get to see seventy per cent of the animals .
yah .
it is not then- it 's good enough if you just do the tram ride .
% uh you already see seventy per cent of the animal .
and i think that would be sort of a wrap up in your second % uh day in singapore .
% uh yes .
just on the tram ride itself without stopping .
without getting off the tram , you would take forty minutes .
yes .
you would actually need more time here .
but % uh if you have just two days , % um- yes this is % uh maybe something that i would be able to recommend you .
based on your requirements .
% um yes , i think % uh based- like i said on what your % uh- well , your coming here of course the highlight , most important one would be your proposal .
a little bit of sightseeing .
a little bit of relaxation .
and not just hopping from place to another .
and i think this would be- well , % uh what i would recommend for you to do in singapore .
well , after a nice holiday , i 'm sure she will remember .
well , okay after the % uh- if you two decide to exit from the park , at the main entrance area , we have what we called the foot reflexology .
okay .
and % uh you will soak your feet in this pool .
% uh and these fishes will come and nibble at your feet .
% uh and they will nibble away all your dead skin .
have you had this experience before ?
yes .
so , you could do that .
% uh and they have % uh a spot of this % uh fish at foot areas- fish spa .
% uh just outside the % um- the night safari park .
yes .
that you can see the picture now .
the- these are doctor fish .
so , they come and nibble at your fish .
and the sensation will be a little of this % uh tingling- ticklish .
yah , ticklish effect .
and then- yah , yes you will feel pretty relaxed after this % um % uh spot of % uh at % uh fifteen minutes .
it 's good enough .
yah % uh relax .
yah .
so , we end up the day with that .
maybe .
yah that 's why the fishes are going i think to her feet .
right ?
okay .
so , you get this % uh well spa .
and you get the nice- at the same time your feet feel relaxed , you know after a day of walking .
and your dead skins are removed .
yes .
so , i think it 's a nice day to end the day .
thanks very much for calling us .
this is lynnette here .
okay . so , thanks again don romeo .
okay . so , thanks again don romeo .
right ?
okay .
okay .
alright % um .
okay .
bye .
okay .
bye .
hello .
hi , i'm- good afternoon .
i 'm jeanne and i am guide number two .
who is calling please ?
june ?
three three , yes ?
okay .
how can i help you , june ?
yes .
% uh , what sort of % uh hotel are you looking at ?
yes , that 's right . % uh-
what-
and that is ?
what is your budget ?
one thousand dollars for the both of you ?
okay .
% um so maybe i gave you a hotel that 's not so expensive .
would you like to go to hotel in chinatown ?
% uh it 's a boutique hotel in a conservation shophouse .
so it 's not like a big fat grand hotel that we get in town , you know .
% uh this is more personal .
% uh not very far .
shall i show you the airport map first then ?
okay .
it 's easier .
% uh actually it 's a- you save money and you save time in the sense that you do n't have to wait for people to pick you out .
it 's more exciting also because you see the locals .
% ah , okay , you- what are you seeing is a portion of the mass rapid transit .
can you see the map with the four colours ?
so where you get this little round dots that joint up are the intersections of the different lines .
when you come in you are at number three on the right-hand side of your screen .
and that is the east-west line
% uh chinatown is on the purple line .
can you see it ?
yes % uh- where you see number six and go you up to outram park and then you go down to chinatown one more stop and that is chinatown .
so if you take % uh the subway to town .
and it 's not all the way subterranean .
it is above ground , so you get a bit of sightseeing right up until kallang which- can you see it on the map ?
on the green line ?
there 's a- so after you pass there % uh you would go from kallang down towards the purple line .
you see outram park ?
and then you go out up one stop to chinatown .
no . % uh i 'm just saying that up to kallang you can see- it 's up above ground .
a few metres .
you can see the area .
and then the ground it goes underground % uh and so chinatown area is busy .
so all that is underground and also up to chinatown .
so when you switch , you just get off your train .
there will be announcements to tell you are coming to an interchange .
you % um follow the directional signs whether you 're going up the stairs or down the stairs , you just switch and most likely you go further deeper into the ground .
so you have to take the escalator down .
and then you take it to chinatown .
okay .
% uh , chinatown is where we have a large congregation of chinese but we also have one of the oldest hindu temples in chinatown and % uh also have mosque and churches there .
there 's a methodist church in that area .
further along the line is little india which is two stops- three stops up north .
and % uh there you can % uh soak in the indian atmosphere .
% ah okay .
and , okay , to show you the relation to the rest of the town .
okay , wait .
if you take the purple line down south can you see number six on the map ?
bottom left-hand side ?
that 's harbourfront and that faces sentosa island % uh where we had-
beaches .
yes , it 's a real island .
it 's an island with beaches but there- there 's also a road link that you can go over
so % uh after i settle your hotel , you just tell me what you are interested in .
okay , the merlion is- okay on the same map , can you see % uh- can you see clarke quay ?
that 's the stop from which you can walk towards the merlion .
okay .
chinatown , alright .
and if you- since we 're on the map , okay .
later you tell me what are the other attractions that you like to visit what is the-
% uh , we have golf courses on sentosa island .
but % uh let me first % uh show you the merlion that you are talking about .
so the mrt map , the map for the trains , do n't show you the location of our rivers .
% uh but here where you see the blue on the map that is formerly just the entrance to the river .
it is now closed in and it 's a reservoir .
the merlion is- do you see a little i there ?
can you see ?
% uh , so that 's the location of merlion park and that 's where the merlion is .
is the half fish and half lion % uh- first emblem of the singapore tourism board , right ?
and- yo- yes it 's for free all the time .
day and night .
% uh huh .
okay .
let me try and get you % uh places where you can golf in singapore first .
okay ?
oh hotel is a little over a hundred dollars i think .
just a minute % uh .
okay , maybe this one is very accessible .
this is also on the bay .
yes , near the merlion .
but % uh you may have to take a taxi there because % uh it is along the highway .
from your hotel , it depends if you 're going during peak hours in the morning there 's a surcharge .
but it should not be more than ten dollars .
so it 's a very nice area because it 's right next to the bay and so you can see the sea % uh right there .
okay , i 'm trying to find it here .
okay .
it 's fine .
it 's a fine day in singapore .
no rain .
yah .
yes , we have also % uh a bit of hazy skies % uh overcast .
i 'm trying to find the price of this for you .
% uh just a minute .
a little more than twenty years .
% uh let me see , huh .
a lot of changes in singapore , a lot of new things .
so you can come back every year and you will get new attractions to see .
just a moment .
okay , these are the rates .
% uh is it a weekend or weekday ?
did i ask you- you said june , right ?
you have n't quite fixed the days .
so- oh !
% uh sorry .
june is your name .
i 'm sorry .
ninth of april up 'til ?
eleventh .
eleventh , yes .
% uh can you tell me off-hand is the ninth a weekend or a weekday ?
so the ninth , yes , it 's a monday .
and you 're checking out .
so good .
so it 's a non-weekend % uh timing so you are more likely to get
% uh to book your % uh golf session because it's- would be a day where people work .
% uh that 's for singaporeans and permanent residents .
you would be in the category of hundred and fifteen dollars .
'cause you 're a visitor .
yes , we do for the golf courses .
% uh and i think there 's some membership if they joined % uh for singaporeans where they get some discount .
okay .
we had the timings earlier , right ?
% uh le~
six a.m . ?
% uh i think it 's still-
i think it 's still dark .
you want the eighteen hole ?
it~ okay , eighteen hole , you want to book the timing , is that right ?
six o'clock it is still dark in singapore .
% uh so i do n't think you can % uh book a course at that time .
see , it 's seven o'clock .
% uh huh .
yes , it 's good because at that time it is very cool still .
the sun will come out % uh about nine and by ten it gets a bit warm .
i thought these are normal times .
% uh what you see here .
this- yes % uh- oh so do you need to see for wednesday .
so for some reason on wednesdays , they have a different timing .
so you 're gon na play golf on tuesday , right ?
okay , what else would you like to know ?
okay , you want to see the hotel ?
okay .
let me get your hotel for you .
so you okay with chinatown ?
it 's very safe , it 's very convenient .
your singapore is a singapore tourism board website that you can go to to help plan your tours .
just give us a-
just a give us a while for it to come on screen .
% uh what were you going to ask me ?
% uh what do you mean % uh like a motel ?
% uh the rooms are small in chinatown and in little india because they occupy what used to be shophouses .
and % uh hotels what they do is they % uh- the owners buy up several % uh units of these of shophouses and convert them into hotels .
but let me show you a picture % uh of the hotel .
can you see here ?
this % uh up .
do you want the picture of the whole hotel ?
you- you want a dining area for the hotel ?
let me have a look .
okay .
well , you do n't need to worry about the dining area .
this is the reception area .
because in chinatown , after you put down your bags you just walk out and there are lots of places to eat .
okay , let me see .
it has got- can you see the amenities ?
internet access , air conditioning , internet services , lounges and bars .
i 'm gon na go to full list .
not in the hotel but in the vicinity plenty of places to eat .
% uh why the restaurants don't- % uh why the hotels they do n't provide food is because i think the guest prefer to just go out and try % uh either street food or food from the cafés and restaurants nearby .
yah .
you might be able to get the % um concierge to buy something for you from somewhere nearby and just pay him for it .
yes , internet services are- all these services here are usually free .
if they want you to pay , they will tell you that you have to pay .
okay , the pictures of the room .
this is the outside .
why do n't i go through the pictures , shall i do that ?
'cause i ca n't quite make out from here % uh what is being shown .
okay .
this is interior .
this is just outside .
this is the entrance .
oh so it is decorated in traditional style % uh with % uh with traditional porcelain ware and there on the side you have tourist brochures that you can pick-up .
free , yes .
for free and they are very informative .
you can- % uh if you get them , the walk of chinatown you 'll be able to % uh follow it and do a walk .
this is a traditional set of % uh tables that we used to have in our kitchen .
so you can have breakfast in your kitchen , marble table and two chairs .
so % uh this is the dining area .
actually i think you can get- can you see this at the corner on the left-hand side ?
you should be able to get snacks like curry puffs , cakes .
% uh coffee and tea .
as you go upstairs , this is your room then .
% uh i do n't think so because these are just three-story buildings .
they 're very small .
% uh they are very cosy because they are in restored buildings that are protected .
are you thinking of % uh more modern type of hotel ?
so- so you want a two to three-star hotel-
three to four-star hotel
okay .
shall we try this furama % uh riverfront hotel .
it 's by the river and % uh it 's a more modern style hotel with larger rooms .
yes , % uh- it 's your preference , you know what i mean ?
this is-
yah .
this is larger-
so the reception areas are larger- let me go through the- % uh it 's going through automatically .
that 's the reception area .
okay i know you now that you like modern hotels , huh .
they have a good buffet spread .
if you have a good appetite .
% uh i have to check that out .
let me see if it 's inclusive of breakfast .
it doesn't- yah .
sorry .
it does n't say here .
it does n't state it .
yes , you go that website .
% uh it 's by the river and it 's not so near to chinatown then .
you have to travel by bus into chinatown .
but this is definitely a bigger hotel , i think more to your taste .
so it would be wi~ no , it 's not far .
it 's about two , three bus stops away .
the chinatown area has another hotel in chinatown but it 's not as pretty as this one from the outside .
it 's an older version of a hotel .
% uh yes , it is .
you have to walk to clarke quay from here .
but it 's within walking distance .
yes , walking distance to clarke quay .
there is another hotel by the river if you want to be on the riverfront , is called the gallery hotel .
but let 's have a look at this one .
there 's another furama - you want to be in the middle of chinatown ?
this is also in the city .
is just % uh not as convenient as the previous hotel that i showed you .
because , the chinatown stop on the subways stops exactly there .
% uh here it is better if you are tired of walking , you can take a bus to connect with the trains to reach your hotel .
you just stop at the city centre and then you get out and you take one bus number one nine five and it will bring you to your hotel in about fifteen minutes or so .
ten minutes actually .
so if we have red lights along the way then its fifteen minutes .
the station is city hall .
it 's a major station and it 's in a business district so you do n't even need to take that train if you outside your hotel if you take the buses , % uh you can go to where city hall is and you can walk around the area .
we have historic buildings there , we have a big theatre and concert hall % uh by the bay .
okay .
oh what you se~ yes , i 'm here .
oh you drop off at city hall station and you take bus number one nine five .
that- that 's not difficult because it will stop you right in front of your hotel .
no we do n't have the size .
% uh our golf courses are separates % uh usually .
% ah yes .
yah .
so % hm . oh % uh would- yah .
so from marina bay if you % uh come out and go to the % uh city centre area that 's where we have the esplanade theatres on the bay .
it 's % uh a big theatre and concert hall .
oh i 'm not suggesting you watch shows .
i 'm just suggesting you have a look at the place % uh and take photos % uh because you are looking out at the marina bay sands hotel which is quite iconic and the % uh bay right in front of the singapore river .
so that 's where many people like to take photographs .
and if you want to have a meal , you can have it % uh inside
% uh the shopping where the % uh theatres are .
can you see the pictures here now ?
durian , yes .
that 's what it 's been called locally .
but , the architect meant it to look like the top of the microphones .
you know the old type of microphone ?
so you know it as the durian also , huh .
yes , it does look like a durian .
% uh so it 's a nice place to take photographs , to walk around , % uh because-
yes , you can go inside .
and % uh we sometimes do have lunchtime concerts .
% uh but that would depend on % um the esplanade 's % uh schedule .
it 's about only forty five minutes or one hour during lunchtime .
it 's to encourage locals to step into our concert hall .
so that you know later on they would buy the concert tickets and attend that concerts .
% uh well it depends on what you are interested in .
% uh lots of great shops here and % uh chocolate shop
and places where you can have a drink or a meal .
but if you do n't do all that ,
you just take a look and then you walk along the outside .
you can see by the ri~ % uh by the theatre , you can reach the marina bay .
so maybe ten , fifteen minutes inside and outside to photograph it
and then you walk to merlion .
i think fifteen minutes with you stopping to take photographs .
yes , you take your photographs , you walk slowly and have a look soak in the atmosphere .
yah .
yes , you can walk and % uh i do that as well .
because , % uh you know , i do n't even think you can take a bus there it 's so near .
right .
from the merlion park , i suggest you get across to % uh boat quay and clarke quay .
% uh see here , you are at the bay in front of the river .
% uh later you % uh walk along the singapore river itself .
and if you are energetic , you can walk all the way home to your hotel .
well , he can play golf , you know .
he is a fit .
so % uh if you did it at seven in the morning , it 's very nice .
i have done it once before .
% uh you come across some joggers , some people walking their dogs .
yes , there are restaurants % uh nearby at- because there 's a big hotel called the fullerton hotel and they own the place in front of the hotel by the river- oh sorry , by the bay .
it 's called one fullerton and there are lots of % uh places you could have a meal .
that place- % uh depends on what you order actually .
% uh if you go inside the hotel and you eat at the jade restaurant , it would cost you a bit more .
maybe % uh sixty or seventy dollars a person .
if you walk along the singapore river ,
% um there are places that serve lunch at prices that office workers can afford .
because many office workers in the area behind , can you see the river on the map ?
so on the south banks of the river where you see north canal road ?
behind that area is the business district .
and some of them would actually eat % uh along the singapore river .
so you can get a meal there fifteen dollars , twenty dollars per person .
more than enough for the both of you .
% uh no , i suggest you take a boat .
would you like to take a boat home ?
you know ?
from the merlion , you can board a boat .
% uh these are electric boats that ply the bay and the river and they also do like a taxi service alo~ with the stops along the river .
and there is one stop
at the back of your hotel .
oh % um if you 're taking the taxi ride , it 's under ten dollars .
% uh if you do a tour with them going around the bay then it 's about fifteen dollars or so .
% uh just by the river , there are restaurant .
i forget the name % um but it was a very good japanese restaurant if you like japanese food .
okay .
singaporean food .
% hm let me see .
at one fullerton .
let me check out one fullerton % uh where- see if they have anything that what- is what i would consider singapore food , huh .
the one fullerton areas for food .
the hotel is the fullerton hotel .
but one fullerton is the name of the area opposite where we have all the restaurants .
yes , of the- okay .
oops !
i got the wrong spelling there .
okay .
singaporean food , you do you like seafood ?
okay , there 's one right next to the merlion .
and this is a website % uh put up by a singaporean who checks out places to eat .
so- so you can get crabs there , you can get a % uh- you- have you heard of chicken - % uh sorry , % uh chili crab ?
can you take hot food ?
so , chili hot , huh ?
okay .
so chili crab is % uh the big crab that is cooked in chili sauce and tomato sauce with onions and egg and a little bit of flour .
so here you see some pictures of it .
if you 're thinki~
yes it 's very nice .
it 's finger licking good , so , you must use your hands to eat .
it 's quite acceptable , yes .
% uh you can tell the waitress that you do n't want to take too hot chili and then they will tone it down .
but if you want more chili , you can tell them also .
you can % uh- what other places- what are your interest besides % uh the golf ?
oh if you do street shopping , then it 's a bit warm .
but if you 're going to the shopping malls , % uh- let me try and get you- do you want to go shopping along the more expensive areas or are you thinking of street shopping ?
% uh shopping malls not really expensive % uh in the sense that the shopping malls have a mix of expensive as well as not so expensive % uh items .
street shopping i think in chinatown you can do it in the evening .
% uh it-
let me tra~
okay , if you want to get away from the heat and near to your hotel , you can visit a museum just across the road .
okay .
yes , the asian civilisations museum .
yes .
let me % uh get you this museum first .
if you talking about history is the singapore history museum .
% uh this one will give you % uh only singapore , the history around the river .
that means the early history of singapore and what went on by the % uh- sorry .
asian-
civilisation .
yes , we import water .
so that museum is % uh- it 's by the bay .
it 's called marina barrage .
are you interested in that ?
% uh it 's just the empty water bottles , huh .
used for the decor it 's called the marina barrage .
and- % uh it will tell you about the bay that you 're looking at right in front of you at the merlion .
so , can you see the pictures there ?
yes , tiny .
so here you go .
so there is % uh or i do n't know whether you can call it a museum but when you enter , it gives you the history of singapore in fact and the development along the rivers .
% uh all the rivers .
our efforts like cleaning up all our rivers because now some of the rivers flow into this area that is called the marina bay .
and that 's how we are able to close it off .
can you see it at this picture here ?
yah , i 'm trying to enlarge it .
it 's a little bit slow .
yes , it 's free .
okay .
so it 's designed a little bit like % uh the number nine .
well for- well it 's just the architect 's design .
but % uh for a chi~ yah , for chinese , we do like number nine also .
we have to wait a little bit % uh for the picture to appear
yes .
we have many shopping districts .
the one that 's most famous is in downtown orchard road .
and there you get many high-end brands .
as well as % uh medium priced .
% uh another place you might want to check out is opposite to sentosa island and it 's called vivocity .
it 's very popular everyday % uh especially in the evenings after work .
vivocity and harbourfront .
% uh , you can get them there .
but you might want to- if you want to save money , you go down to chinatown and you would be able to % uh buy more things with your money .
yah .
% uh you might want to have dinner % um- let me see , huh ?
marina barrage .
do you want to have dinner at % uh the marina bay sands ?
% uh it 's an integrated resort with very high-end % uh restaurants .
so % uh- maybe two , three hundred dollars for the both of you .
yes .
so-
yah , that said so .
but here you get sort of- can you see fine dining and casual dining ?
so if you do n't pick fine dining it would n't be so expensive then .
let me think , huh .
let me find a- a hotel maybe at the- how much- what is your budget ?
so-
so your budget for this good meal , that does n't cost too much ?
% uh huh .
and your- your golf is a hundred and fifteen so you have to take that off .
so you have % uh- four hun~ five-
four hundred .
double- five- five hundred and thirty five dollars , and you do n't want to spend it all on dinner ?
% ah okay .
two hundred .
so you can eat here .
so two hundred if you take it out for shopping you still have three hundred over dollars for a fine meal .
so you can even do fine dining here .
i see .
yes .
okay , we got the menu for you here and should have a price there .
can you read it ?
you ca n't see the price .
let me see .
fo~ the- yes , that is right .
so , you see , if you do n't order of full meal from salad , soup , main meal and then have a dessert and coffee it would n't cost you so much .
it's- if you go the all- the full works with wine and everything then it would be more expensive .
yes , it 's % uh the chefs are well-known and the ambiance is good .
and it's-
% uh it 's not really floating .
it looks floating .
it 's a three towers % uh on the opposite side of the bay .
so from where you are looking at it , sometimes it looks like it 's floating .
yes , you are right .
so that is the hotel and integrated resort .
so we have a casino there actually .
that 's the marina bay sands .
but % uh-
know it .
yes , that 's right .
% uh whether it 's at the top of the hote~ it may not be right at the top because they have a swimming pool .
it may be there , i 'm not very sure .
yes , bistro moderne i 'm not sure .
a few hotels are at the top but i can not confirm with you whether this one is at the top .
% uh huh .
your welcome .
is there anything else you need to know ?
okay .
right .
so have dinner at bistro moderne then .
okay ?
okay .
welcome .
bye .
hello .
emile , e m i l e ?
% oh i see .
that 's an original spelling .

can you tell me your interest please for yourself and your friend ?
% uh do you hang out with this friend all the time ?
okay , you want to go to the beach .
% uh do you have any other interest besides the beach ?
okay .
so i will handle the beach first , alright ?
would you like to a beach on an island ?
have you heard of sentosa island ?
okay , let me % uh show you-
okay .
okay .
yes .
yes , it is easily accessible .
and it has got other interesting places besides the beach .
no , they are attractions of sentosa .
the whole island % uh has been transformed into an island % uh for fun , for relaxation not only for tourist but also for singaporeans also .
yes , we have amusement park there , we have % uh resorts world singapore with % uh universal studios .
% uh if you are not into rides and , you know disneyland kind of % uh background % uh because i notice you 're interested on the be~ about the beach .
you can also visit an aquarium on the island where you can see fishes .
okay .
so-
okay .
so here you are looking at % uh view of the beach front side of the island which is off the-
yes .
sentosa island and you can easily get across by shuttle bus that is provided by the la~
yes .
% uh let me go to siloso beach , because i want to-
% uh siloso beach .
i do n't know how it got its ' name but i believe it 's filipino for jealousy .
yes , % oh jealous .
yes , that is right .
so here you can see some scenes people playing % uh not % uh badminton but volleyball .
no it 's vol~ yah , on the beach normally they play volleyball .
because if there is a breeze % uh , yah .
i think your % uh shuttle cock might blow away into the water .
% uh yes frisbee also .
yes on the beach .
definitely frisbee .
% uh and if you enjoy volleyball , if they are playing , you and your friend can also ask to join them .
they would be happy to invite you .
% uh so-
yes , on the beach .
so if you bring along a frisbee , you and your friend can enjoy playing that also .
% hm , you can % uh-
yes , % uh that 's when % uh group of friends usually on vacation during the school holidays .
yes , siloso beach .
and i 'm going to % uh bring you to underwater world which is just- % uh from the beach , you just walk to % uh underwater world .
yes it 's all on sentosa island .
yes and you notice there 's also a fort there .
can you see siloso point ?
so we will do underwater world first .
they 're all in the same location .
yes , yah .
there 's a dolphin show and you can-
% uh dolphin is an add-on to the show .
% uh the-
% uh no , it 's part of underwater world where you- it 's % uh , yah .
yah it 's a big aquarium and it 's unusual because i believe this was the first time and it started what ?
% uh twenty or more years ago that you also become % uh an exhibit for the fish .
% uh because in the aquarium , % uh in the sunken section , you walk- stand on a travelator around- % uh that goes around the aquarium and that means there 's gigantic fish tank all around you .
yes .
% uh i have n't been to ocean park but % uh if you have the same technology now , i think they have the same idea in other parts of the world .
but % uh when it first opened , % uh we were told that singapore was the first one .
so where you see the % uh-
yes , the dolphin lagoon is-
% uh dolphin lagoon is outside the aquarium , it 's part of underwater world .
and you can see the dolphins performing .
and if you like you can also pay a small fee and you- if you do n't mind getting wet , go down and % uh play with the dolphins .
just a little short while , you know .
because dolphins are very friendly , but we do n't want them to be , you know , % uh too long with humans .
they need to be with the dolphins .
% uh surfing , i 'll have to check that out .
% oh not on sentosa island .
sentosa island is n't % um- you know the beaches are very calm and % uh , yah .
surfing , you need to have very big waves , right ?
% uh singapore our island is % uh a port and part of the reason it is attractive to the shipping % uh community in the very early days when people use fishing bo~ % uh sailing boats , is that the waters here are very calm .
we are protected by nearby islands .
% uh rent a swimming pool ?
you can stay in a hotel with a pool if you like .
yes .
okay , sentosa is a huge amusement park .
what sort of amusement are you looking at ?
animal and wildlife or theme parks .
wildlife , okay .
i 'll get out of this and % uh we 'll go to one of my favourite places .
actually three of my favourite places .
so i 'll go to their website .
yes , this is the website .
and you 'll be able to see some pictures .
there are three parks manage by wildlife reserves ; the bird park , the singapore zoo .
both of which you visit in the day .
it 's an open zoo next to a reservoir .
so it is very % uh unusual .
you do n't see so many animals within cages , % uh , yah .
so you know zoos normally % uh when you take photographs sometimes it 's does n't look real .
but at the singapore zoo , you can , you know produce a photograph as though you are seeing the animal out in the wild .
yes , you can mingle with them .
% uh and let me get to the bird park first , okay ?
yes , for the wildlife website .
the wildlife reserves .
yes .
have you seen hornbills ?
here you see the real ones now .
there are % uh very big aviaries where the hornbills are inside and they have successfully breed in singapore .
so we have singapore citizen hornbills .
and % uh we in fact have been so successful .
we have release them into % uh mainland singapore .
that means they become naturalised already and maybe when you come down the shopping area , you might even see a hornbill flying over your head .
so- but here you can see the hornbills close-up .
different varieties of them .
yes , so different colours .
so i 'm trying to show you a little bit more of the % uh bird park .
okay , attractions .
so here you can see free-flight aviary .
so here you walk in and you can see the birds feeding .
you go inside , the birds are flying all around you .
so you 're actually inside the aviary .
and these feeding trace are very near the path where you walk , and the birds are- they are used to tourist and locals feeding up-
% uh feeding ?
% uh the food is put there for you take photographs .
but if you get the schedule of the feeding time when you enter then you can time yourself to be at the areas when they are feeding .
and if you are tired walking , there is a monorail .
in fact the only monorail in the world that drives into an aviary .
so the monorails stops inside this big huge % uh like a bird cage that you are actually inside .
all the-
yes , that 's right .
or you can take the ride and then after that you have seen an overview at everything and then you start walking .
and now for feeding , you can not bring your own bird seeds .
you have to % uh pay a small sum from the keeper % uh-
yes , just a few dollars .
he will give you a little cup of worms .
yes .
do you like to handle worms ?
okay , when you carry the cup and the birds fly in and take it off the cup .
but if you like to try , you let the worms sort of tickle your arm and they come down and feed .
yes , in this aviary , they are fed live worms .
yes , so you know , % um it 's a healthier food for them .
and all around you are fruit trees , and trees that the birds feed on .
and you see the waterfall at the back of this picture ?
yes , it 's very nice place for photography .
so two of you going , you can stand there and take photographs .
huh .
% uh you can also walk up the hill of that % uh aviary .
it 's a very quiet place .
% uh the park is sighted on the side of a hill .
so % uh there are some areas that many tourist do not go to because you have to climb just a little bit % uh-
yah it 's like % um maybe two floors , you know , you 're climbing two floors instead of taking the lift .
and you- those areas are very quiet .
so if you sit there quietly with your friend , he would be able to get very natural photographs of the birds with the trees in the background .
because the birds stop and feed .
and we also have % uh shows .
yes , bird shows .
% uh the bird show is a different variety of show .
let me see if i can get it .
yes , in that place also .
okay .
so can you see some pictures here on your right ?
% uh this is in an open area and you get eagles , hawks and falcons , % uh owls also swooping down just a few inches from the top of your head .
so when you watch the show , you and your friend must remained seated .
you must remember that .
it 's very exciting because % uh they are very close to you , and you see this girl on the right ?
yes , that is right .
it 's a % uh a reproduction .
so we do n't have a mongolian person there , but he 's dressed like a mongolian .
so we try to give some information in these shows to tell you the background of how the % uh hawks were trained .
% uh if you volunteer like this lady here , % uh you do n't have to be % uh lady .
yes , you % uh- this one , you know , % uh she 's % uh probably a park worker because they used her for the advertisement .
% uh you can also volunteer and have them land on you because you are adults .
if you are a young child , they will not select you .
no , she is a park % uh staff .
i know her .
yes , i recognise her .
she 's one of the trainers of the birds .
so i think % uh instead of paying a model to model for this she did it but % uh there are many people who are very happy to go up on stage and % uh take photographs % uh with the birds .
you have to wear a glove .
can you see where her hand is ?
where the birds is ?
yes , it 's a very thick leather gloves .
so you do n't worry , your- the bird will not , you know , % um hurt your fingers .
yes and it was a sport % um with the middle eastern people also .
well , not if they are singaporeans around there .
not many mongolians in singapore .
we also have shows for children , but i mean this is more exciting show % uh that you may want-
yes , that 's right for adults .
so-
yes an owl .
% uh they actually show you how % um you can train a bird .
% uh birds are very difficult to train .
be~ yes , i have seen the training sessions .
some of the birds fly up the trees and they just do n't come down .
so-
% uh i 'm not sure .
i do n't think a week is enough .
can i show you the other locations ?
the zoo and the % um the zoo and the night safari .
% uh no , you just watch them .
because those animals are very difficult to train .
and we are- we do n't take risk with our tourist .
but you can see a nude lady here .
i do n't know if she 's a lady .
do you see the picture ?
this is % uh naked mole rat .
naked because it has got no hair .
yes that is right .
% uh i 'm not a scientist .
but i 'm sure those teeth have some reason .
probably to dig the tunnel and also to get food .
% uh that is like the latest attraction , you know .
so- yes because i have n't seen it myself .
so- yes , this is one of the shows you can see .
% um and you can also participate at the end of the show by feeding .
so you just pay a few dollars to the keeper , and he will provide you the food .
you must understand that this is to make sure the animals are fed with healthy food , you know we do n't want them to get
yes we have elephants rides as well .
yes , you can also do that .
no , it 's not so high because the ride in singapore is not a very long journey .
% uh i do n't know whether you 've taken this rides before .
% uh it 's a little bit bumpy .
% uh so the rides are not extensive .
you know what i mean ?
because go to some other countries , they go into the jungle and halfway if you do n't like it , you have to maybe complete the circuit .
yes , that is right .
yes .
in fact i just went there and % uh my % uh nieces they went on the elephant rides .
% uh you can also sit on horses .
% uh we have % uh horses
yes , for- that 's for children % um of up to a certain % uh heights .
and someone will lead them on the path .
can you see this % uh jungle breakfast with wildlife ?
% uh yo~
no that 's an orangutan .
yes .
% uh these are- % uh now that there are in singapore for a long time , % uh we feel confident enough to put them in the open but % um in a certain areas .
so % uh lots of trees and trees that have fallen , we 've use them to create a pathway for the orangutans to climb and to walk .
% uh you do n't really feed them .
what you do is you take a photograph with them .
so you see you are eating a normal breakfast here .
and the orangutan would % uh have his own breakfast .
because his basket there is full of fruits .
bananas , % uh durian .
have you heard of durian ?
% uh smelly food but very delicious like sweet custard .
so when it 's seasoned he gets to eat it .
% um the-
i ca n't quite tell .
% um sometimes when they come out , they bring along their baby .
then you know for sure it 's a female .
so after breakfast , the trainer will invite you to go up and take a photograph with the orangutan .
so you just have to be careful not to touch the young .
% uh or-
% oh yes , there 's a restaurant right there which is glass all around .
so while you 're eating , you can watch-
% uh it 's a different restaurant .
% uh this is a programme only in the morning where you can take photographs % uh with the orangutan .
when you are having % uh dinner or lunch , % uh you do n't have this programme available .
but we have restaurants within the zoo in air-conditioned areas if you think it 's too hot or you may want to sit outside .
so there is % uh- can you see the list of restaurants there ?
so-
so that 's a pizza joint .
there 's a
yes and ben and jerry 's ice cream .
and ah ming is the name of our escort orangutan who has passed away .
and she was given-
yes , a female who was very popular and she 's been buried at the zoo .
if you like you can visit the burial spot .
% uh this is the restaurant there .
i think may be a ye~ two years ago , i 'm not sure .
yes .
so because-
no , this restaurant no was built much longer but it has been furbished .
but it has been given her name in honour of her service % uh to the zoo in popularising the zoo .
she was an ambassador .
so in this restaurant you can get all kinds of food and outside the restaurant there is also % um indian food , there is chinese food .
so if you want to eat quickly and % uh move on then maybe you just eat just the area just outside the restaurant .
and % uh-
it 's a big area and this is right where the orangutans are % uh swinging around the trees % uh so you can see % uh the attractions and eat .
you do n't really waste time .
okay , so i 'll show you the other attraction .
so we also have a river safari first .
let me show you this .
this is the latest .
it 's within the zoo and you-
% uh yes , there are crocodiles .
we have crocodiles in the zoo , you can look at within like one metre , two metres , you know .
% uh they are in an enclosure , so % uh they can not climb up the wall .
so it 's a good view .
yes just opened .
i do n't remember exactly the date , but % uh just a few months .
% uh so it re-creates the % um famous rivers throughout the world and the forest .
yah so-
yes , the pandas , can you see on the right-hand side ?
they will be coming soon to singapore .
they are not quite here yet .
not right now if you came .
% uh you have to wait for the announcements from the % uh zoo .
yes , because they have to prepare the environment .
% uh pandas are very fussy about their food .
they eat bamboo and we want to make sure that when they come here , they are healthy , they smile when you take photographs of them .
yah .
so % uh you take a ride along the river and when you 're taking that ride , the keeper the person who was with you , the guide , will show you specimens from the zoo .
like % um you know anima~ the snakes when they moult , they leave behind the skin .
so it 's impossible for us to see it because in the forest , people would walk on it but you would be able to see this is dried out .
because the keepers pick it up from the % uh snake enclosure and then they dry it out .
so you 'd be able to see things like that .
skulls of animals .
pictures of specimens % uh i 'm not sure .
let me try conservation .
yah .
% oh here you get a close up of the orangutan .
yes .
% uh no . this is not ah ming .
so i think this is another orangutan .
% uh ah ming is so famous .
we all know her photo .
we all know what she looks like .
and education because % uh the zoo participates in helping not only % um wildlife in singapore but also % uh other places in the region .
yah . i % um-
yah . i % um- we want to encourage singaporeans to be conservation conscious .
and so we have programmes for the schools where they go there and % uh- it 's a special programme where the
the keepers are trained to teach them to be % uh aware of the need for a natural environment .
yah .
yes .
you can see how many we have bred .
orangutan , golden lion tamarin , % uh
yes , king cobra .
% uh we have a walk-in snake enclosure .
% uh do you like to see snakes close-up ?
% uh if you do n't have a phobia of it , you can walk through because i have done it .
% uh the snakes are usually the tame variety the ones that do n't move around and go after humans smell .
so they are on the trees , they are around you .
so it 's quite exciting % uh to see .
but otherwise , you do n't have to go through there , yah .
% uh we have white rhino .
yah and-
yes .
malaysian- malayan tapir you can see close to you when we visit the night safari .
so with this breeding programme , we exchange some of the % uh animals where we have % uh very many with other zoos .
% oh no . % uh the zoo is for diurnal animals .
that means those are % uh active in the day .
so it will close % um % uh about six i think .
six , about six , yes .
% um and if you want to go to all three parks like the bird park zoo and night safari , i suggest % uh you go to the bird park in the morning and then you go to-
yes .
and then you go to the zoo and the zoo is next door to the night safari that opens only at seven thirty .
so you can eat if you 're hungry your dinner at the zoo .
and then just a short walk about ten minutes away across the car park to the night safari .
or you can walk across to the night safari and there is a dining area that they allow you in earlier .
yes .
yes there are restaurants there and there are % um something like fast food , you know .
% uh burgers , % uh-
% oh no , not kfc .
they both the zoo and the night safari and bird park , they manage their own food and beverage .
so % uh where the restaurants are concerned , % uh they run the restaurants themselves .
so if you see like ben and jerry 's , okay , then they have allowed ben and jerry 's to operate there .
but the restaurants proper are run by wildlife reserves themselves .
okay , i come to the pricing in awhile .
let me bring you to the % uh night safari first .
yes , it 's very famous .
have you heard about it before ?
okay , because it is a zoo that shows nocturnal animals .
yes .
so here you see remember the malayan tapir that you saw ?
% uh they were bred in the zoo and we have quite a few of them .
they are also nocturnal and diurnal .
that means you can see them in the day and at night active .
yes % uh-
you- the tram that is % uh painted like a tiger it can bring you around the zoo- % uh sorry , the night safari .
and then you-
yah , you get off and here the leopard trail .
yah , you have to walk .
yah , for the giraffes you can see % um just , you know , on the tram you can see because they 're very tall .
and the tapirs you can see because they are roaming around .
but for the leopard you have to get off and walk .
and you see this couple ?
% uh there 's actually glass between the leopards and them , yes .
and % uh we put some food nearby , so that they will be there where there is light .
so some people think- you see the background is very dark .
yes .
but you see when the leopards come- i think the leopards also think that the couple there is % uh nice for eating , you know .
so they come near .
% uh but the glass is very strong .
% uh so where we have animals like tigers , leopards , lions .
% um the enclosure is very secure .
% uh yes .
malayan tapir because it 's indigenous to the region .
it % uh has been breeding successfully .
and % uh giraffes , i think giraffes we just had baby giraffe if i 'm not mistaken .
yah .
so sometimes the tapir will come in the front of the tram and then the tram can not move .
because it has to wait for the tapir to across the road .
the only thing is you can not take photographs when you 're in the night safari .
okay let-
% uh pictures of nocturnal animals , let me see .
leopard trail , okay .
let me show you the shows , okay ?
yes , this is creature of the night .
it 's very exciting .
so you should-
okay here before you enter , just now you saw a short flash of a tribal show .
yah .
and yes the pictures keep changing , we ca n't control that .
% uh so you can see the elephants .
so this is a depiction of the tribes doing the dance with fire .
% uh you can volunteer for this also or- % uh you need to very strong because that % uh-
% uh python is very heavy , yes . i could n't carry it .
% uh python is very heavy , yes . i could n't carry it .
and this is the leopard hand .
% uh after the show-
yes , fire % uh-
yes fires because the background is dark .
so with the fire , you know fire eating .
% uh you 'll be able to photograph very nicely .
get good photographs .
yes , during the night % uh you can visit the zoo and then you just walk across the road to the night safari .
so % uh i would recommend better to eat at the night safari because when you 're eating % uh
yah , you see the show and if there is a long queue people buying tickets , and you have n't bought your tickets yet , % uh you can queue up and buy the tickets first before other tourist groups come along .
because the night safari is very popular .
yes and % uh to control the crowd as you are walking in , we have % uh-
yes .
% uh it depends on your size , you know .
there wo~ when they ask for volunteers , you need to-
% uh that 's right , so big .
but after the show , okay , i 'm gon na show you- try and show you some pictures of the % uh-
yah you see ?
so the whole night safari is divided into zones .
so on the right side , you can see the different zones .
so as you pass by , you 'd be able to see these animals .
okay ?
so from the himalayan foothills , so this would be the animals you get at the himalayan foothills .
the guide on the tram will draw your attention to where they are .
okay .
yes .
% um this rhino looks as though he is wearing an armour .
he 's like- these are armour plated , you know ?
like he is wearing a metal suit .
it 's a quite huge .
% uh well he 's been here quite some years .
but i do n't know his exact age .
and we have a
% uh this is a wolf i think .
yup , wolf .
% uh probably wild dogs descended from them .
% uh this one is indians sub continents .
let see- so africa , the african animals are very beautiful .
and they have stripes % uh colours .
i 'm afraid i do n't know the name of this particular one % uh-
yes it 's from africa .
so % uh it 's in the area of africa that is like singapore , equatorial , you know .
so-
yah , so can you see so it 's hot and humid and red .
so within that area , we also re-create the zone .
where we were % uh the first slide we saw we try and build like cliffs for them .
they are not real cliffs but we re-create the environment , yah .
have you see the tigers ?
okay , it should be coming up on your screen .
in the day zoo , you see the white tigers .
have you heard of- yes , it 's a gene that is % uh mutated long ago that they found in bangalore and then they bred it until we have a gene pool for tigers that come out white .
so for
% oh we have % uh three white tigers .
so there it 's at the zoo .
so you wo n't miss it .
it will be on the trail as you are walking and so you can see their relatives here % uh in the night safari .
these are the natural-
yah natural .
so tigers in fact % uh can still be seen in malaysia , our % uh neighbouring country .
but in singapore there is-
yah in the malayan region .
india and % uh malayan .
in singapore they are extinct already , huh .
we ca n't have them roaming down the streets .
so- so here also , so-
% uh that 's the one that 's roaming around .
you have seen it already .
okay , i think this is the gar .
it 's a big like a buffalo .
yah buffalo .
that 's found still in burma .
and we also have walking trails .
yes , that 's right .
% uh yes , different countries , different continents % uh-
yes .
i 'm trying to find you the pricing .
yes .
okay .
so if you are interested in all three attractions , i suggest you buy a package ticket called the park hopper special .
can you see it on your screen ?
yes that means you hop from park to park .
you know what i mean ?
you- during % uh for duration of one month , thirty days , you can use this ticket for all three parks .
yes , so you will not exceed the thirty days .
so-
that 's right .
so % uh if i scroll down a little bit you can see % uh- see if you just visit the night safari , the admission plus the tram ride would be thirty two dollars .
yes , per person .
but if you pay forty two , that means only ten dollars more you 'll get the bird park as well .
but if you pay fifty eight , then you can go to the singapore zoo .
park , bird park , night safari as well as the singapore zoo .
% oh jurong bird park then you just pay the fee a little bit lower than % uh forty two , yes .
but % uh you want to go back to jurong bird park .
i think it 's % uh bird park under twenty dollars .
for sure .
less than that .
you want to know the exact prices ?
you 're not interested in the night safari or the zoo ?
let me see , huh .
okay .
okay , so yah i 'm right twent- % uh eighteen dollars .
yes that is right .
so if you take the panorail ride , remember i told you it 's the only panorail ride that brings you inside the % uh bird aviary .
where you saw the birds flying around .
you add another five dollars , then it would be twenty three dollars .
% uh no , it doesn't- you- the aviary is free , but if you want to take the panorail ride , around the park it 's another five dollars .
yes that 's right .
it will bring you not only to the waterfall aviary , but to another area where you see lorries , you know , parakeets from australia .
that are flying around , yes .
so you just get on , you get off and you show your ticket again and you can get on again .
so just now you remember fifty eight dollars , you visit three parks .
and here if you pay eighteen dollars you visit one park .
so if you do n't want to take the ride , it 's only eighteen dollars .
% uh you 're talking about all three ?
% uh only one jurong bird park is twenty three dollars .
yes five dollars .
you buy the ticket , in other words you decide at the time that you are buying the ticket and % uh you just show the ticket .
siloso beach if you are just swimming , it 's % uh two dollars to enter the island an~
and then one dollar for % um taking the shuttle bus from the bus bay outside % uh the island .
yes .
when you come out , you do n't have to pay any money .
so you still have lots of money leftover from your thousand dollars .
% uh lots of souvenirs you can buy when you 're on siloso beach and also when you are at the zoo .
% uh sorry , at the bird park .
at all the three parks and at sentosa , you can buy lots of souvenirs .
% uh no not at jurong bird park , but on sentosa there are hotels for you to stay .
% uh yes .
siloso beach , you want to stay on the island ?
okay , let me see .
because we have n't found you a hotel yet , have we ?
yes .
you 're only staying one night , so we have % uh lots of hotel .
let 's see .
% uh on the beach -
yah costa sands is my recommend-
yes , costa sands .
yes , % uh in fact sometimes singaporeans check-in there during the school holidays .
because it 's just along the beach .
you can just walk down the beach .
see it 's on a hill , overlooking siloso beach .
yes you ca~ yes , you can .
it 's like a regular resort .
you just booked the rooms there .
can you see the price here ?
so eighty nine .
off-peak up 'til two hundred and fifteen .
so i guess it depends on the time .
yah it depends on the time you go .
let me see whether i can get- no , i ca n't get the rates there .
let me see .
yes that 's for the hotel .
the pictures are appearing now .
can you see % uh the- you only look at the one that says sentosa .
the third one from your left .
just wait .
i 'm trying to find the dates for you .
no downtown east is at another location .
there are four hotels manage by the group .
so when do you think you want to
yes definitely sentosa .
you are near to attractions and you like i said you could visit the underwater world .
% uh yah , what are your dates ?
then we can find out then- april - april five , okay .
that 's a monday , okay good .
april % uh .
% oh sorry , thursday .
we were on march , yes .
so five to six you 're staying one night , is that right ?
okay , so let 's check out the prices .
you have to be-
yes off-peak because it 's the middle of the week , and it 's also school term .
and you see the school term ?
holiday is in % uh may , yah .
it 's in may .
so april the children are in school in singapore so nobody checks in .
so you want to know the rate ?
okay .
% uh so one room with % uh twin beds or double beds .
% oh you need to stay two nights .
shall we check out the- you have lots of money so you can stay two nights , huh .
because the maximum prices of the room is only two hundred over dollars .
yah , so you said you have a thousand to spend .
so can you see the pricing on your screen ?
yes it 's daily rate so it would be two to nine .
let say two thirty times two , % uh four hundred and sixty dollars .
yes much cheaper .
yah yes .
yes a minimum of two nights .
yes .
it 's % uh less than half the price .
% uh it 's during the time that you want to go , that is the price .
are you able to extend your stay ?
because one night is not really enough time for singapore .
and you have a lot of money for singap~
okay .
yah because you can stay there , you can spend a whole day at the beach and visit the underwater world i was telling you about .
% um i 'm adding up the cost .
% uh so twenty three for your bird park , % uh twenty five for underwater world .
three dollars to enter sentosa .
yah well including the one dollar is three dollars .
that 's why i say % uh you have lots of money .
yes , huh .
of course we wo n't do the bookings now .
okay .
so you can see how much money you are spending .
okay .
and maybe we add-in- let say it 's a big % um figure , you will get your change back for taking the % uh mass rapid transit to travel around by train and the bus .
so allow thirty dollars per person .
yes .
okay .
so-
you 're welcome .
and i hope you 'll come back and visit % uh singapore for more days .
thank you very much .
thank you .
bye bye amil .
bye bye .
hello .
good afternoon .
i 'm jeanne , guide number two from singapore .
may i know your name ?
number thirty nine .
jen is it j e n ?
okay .
% uh how can i help you , jen ?
your budget is more than enough for- because two days is only one night .
so you can in fact stay two nights .
% uh but i need to know who are you travelling with please .
so you 're bringing your friend , okay .
how many of % uh- sorry .
so two of you only , is it ?
and it 's a girl you are travelling with ?
okay , and you are in your twenties i assume ?
% oh you sounded a very young thirty then , okay .
well , you 're still young at thirty , so it 's not a problem , huh .
% uh can i know % um what are your preferences ?
what do you normally enjoy % uh back home ?
% uh you want to stay in places where 's , there is greenery , % uh garden setting , is it ?
well , we have resort hotels on sentosa island .
but % uh for two nights , it might be a little bit % uh costly , unless you stay % uh on the beach front .
% uh we have a more affordable hotel on the beach front that i can recommend to you , so you can walk around the island and enjoy the beaches as well .
is that suitable for you ?
okay .
okay , the city lights % uh the architecture is very % uh accessible from the island , because % uh this island is off the south of singapore and it 's also % uh , you know , connected by train and by road .
so , let me show you a map of singapore , so that you have an idea of locations .
and then you can % uh make up your mind if you like that or not .
so can you get the map on your screen ?
okay .
so i 'm trying to enlarge it for you .
so here you see singapore with its neighbouring country , malaysia to the north of us .
so we are an island surrounded by water .
and the island i 'm suggesting you stay is right down south .
% uh sort of triangular shape .
if you see bukit merah on the map , can you see it ?
in the south .
in the middle of the island right at the bottom .
you saw that ?
okay , across from there , there are two islands .
and the bigger island is sentosa island .
okay , so now you can see it ?
now , the city and all these other lines , did you see ?
% uh these are roads .
and later i 'll show you a map of the subway system .
which is also integrated with the bus system % uh at bus interchanges at there .
there are lots of people using public transport .
so it 's very easy to move around in singapore .
yah .
yes , % uh in fact i suggest you take the train because it 's faster and it 's % uh-
% uh actually travel is by distance .
so , by distance the trains are more expensive to set up .
so it would be a little bit more expensive for journeys .
% uh short journeys that you do in town will just cost you % uh a dollar twenty if you go little bit further out .
and bus journeys % uh will be under a dollar .
% uh this is just a rough guide .
let me show you where % uh the airport of singapore is and with the train connections .
so i 'll show you the mrt map .
so mrt is the mass rapid transit .
and that is the name of our % uh subway which is also above ground in certain parts .
and the lrt you saw on the map is a light rail to support it .
that one i do n't think you 'll be taking .
it leads people right up to the doorstep .
so- can you see % uh number three on the map ?
yes on the right .
so this is the eastern tip of the island .
and that is our airport , international airport .
so if you come in here and you go down to the basement , there is an office that will sell you the tickets for the subway .
and , you can put value in it .
in fact , you have to put value in it , so that % uh as you use the subway and the passes ,
the value is deducted .
so they a tour advantages , you do n't have to worry about the fare and you also don't- you also get a discount .
every time you connect the journey % uh you 'll get a discount .
so it makes it very attractive .
yes , that 's right .
no , you do n't have to .
okay .
% uh the card is called the ez-link card .
yah , it is the size of a credit card .
and it 's a contactless card .
so you just tap it at the sensor when you are entering the stations .
and tap it at % uh when you come out , the gate will open when you are on the subway .
and if you are in the bus , you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus .
because otherwise , % uh the system will assume that you 've taken the journey right up to the end .
because they are not reading anything on your card .
so you tap in and you tap out .
so that 's what you need to do .
okay , huh .
so that is very easy % uh and you can get the cards .
% uh well for me at the airport for you is the most convenient .
but if % uh you suddenly travel all over singapore , you have used up all the value .
% uh you can go to a seven eleven store that 's open twenty four hours , and you just put in a little bit more money .
no , it 's not extra , you 're just putting value into the card .
so % uh this makes it convenient , because seven eleven stores are all over singapore .
% uh even at petrol stations .
so you- if you should run out of money in the card .
but usually i suggest that people % uh put in more than enough and then when they leave , go back to the officer and get your refund % uh before you leave .
so you do n't have to worry about it .
% uh you can also use the card for sightseeing .
i did it once with a friend .
i use the trains to go all around singapore % uh and once we 're out of the city , it is above ground , so you can see all around you .
yah , the only thing is we came back to her hotel so which was % uh it showed on the card that we had % uh travelled only maybe one-stop away , because we stop one-stop away from her hotel .
and we have to pay two dollars surcharge .
this is to discourage people using the system % uh to make friends , chit chat inside , you know , the train station so 'cause they are very comfortable .
so that is the only thing , yah .
and you can do that to because i think two dollars is the very % uh small fee to pay , right ?
% um so where do you want to live in singapore ?
where do you want to stay ?
% uh , so you want a beach hotel or you want to stay in an ethnic area ?
okay , ethnic area we have two % uh that is % uh very easily % uh connectable for you , you can from there to other places .
one is chinatown and one is little in~
so in chinatown you get more % uh chinese food , souvenirs .
% uh in little india you can have a big variety of indian food , % uh and you can visit a lot of hindu temples .
% uh in % uh little india in fact we have % uh buddhist temple and also a church there .
a few churches in fact % uh within the area because we are multi-cultural and multi-religious .
also in chinatown , at the heart of chinatown , in fact it 's one of older hindu temples which is also a national monument .
and our oldest chinese temple is there and it 's all within walking distance .
but you wo n't get your greenery around there , you know .
so if you want a greenery , you want a resort view , then it would be sentosa island .
okay where price is concerned , % uh little india and chinatown has % uh lower priced hotels .
because in their locations the rents are lower than in the island .
% uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars , you should be able to get a hotel , a decent size hotel .
which is also a good rate .
in chinatown , well , you do n't want a dormitory , do you ?
where you share the bed with other people ?
yah , so if you want to have a room to yourself , about eighty to a hundred sixty % uh you should be able to get a decent size % uh room in chinatown .
yes , per night yes .
% uh meals it depends on the hotel .
some of them do not provide meals , because all around , where the hotel is , there are food outlets .
so sometimes it not worth the while to provide the meal .
so it actually depends on the individual hotel .
in little india you can get hotels in this price range and even cheaper .
so % uh what sort of food do you enjoy ?
safe food so- in- % uh safe food , so do you have chinese food in your country ?
% uh so-
yah , indian food the only problem is if you take too much chili , and some people can find it too hot on the tongue .
so-
okay , so we will check out the hotels in chinatown .
and we 'll show you a variety and with their prices .
and so you can have a look .
chinatown is busy day and night but they have other % uh they have hotels along the small streets , they have hotels along the main road .
so i can tell you from the location whether it 's a quieter part of chinatown or not .
% uh we also have very good class boutique hotels in chinatown .
and here you can soak up the atmosphere .
okay .
% uh if you 're thinking of regular size hotels , you know , the normal idea of hotel , it would be furama city centre .
can you see % uh on the screen ?
yes , furama city centre .
so eu tong seng street is one of the main road in chinatown .
% uh below that you see another road called keong saik road , and that is a small lane off the major roads of chinatown and it 's on the quieter side of chinatown .
also bukit pasoh and here you can see the hotel price it is also like a business hotel rate , % huh .
yes , so i think % uh we will not consider that , right ?
what do you think ?
okay , i thought you would like the money for shopping or some other thing , huh .
% uh we have also new bridge road which is also along the main road , % uh santa grand hundred and forty eight .
and santa grand has two hotels , one they call it chinatown hundred and forty eight and lai chun yuen which is hundred and forty five .
so it 's about same price .
lai chun yuen is % uh closer right into the heart of chinatown .
even better we have this one along the side street , the inn at temple street .
can you see it ?
% uh that 's only one eight .
and below a hundred , keong saik hotel .
it takes his name from the road .
% uh the quieter side of town .
on the quieter side also at the bottom we have scarlet hotel but you can see the price it 's two six five .
it is a-
yes , it 's luxury class yah .
so % uh porcelain hotel is on the main road .
so % uh maybe a little bit busier when you come out .
so it 's your choice whether you want to be just off the main street or you would like to be in the- on the main road , because off the main street , you just walk out and five minutes , you 're into the shopping area , into where the restaurants , the cafés , the street side shopping is .
off the main road is also maybe three , four minutes away .
off the main road .
okay , let 's have a look again .
okay .
so , furama city centre is off because that is main road .
okay , off the main road we have i think at % uh the upper end is the hotel nineteen twenty nine and it 's very popular , it 's very trendy .
it was one of the first hotels in chinatown converted out of places where people use to shop .
% uh start to shop downstairs and live upstairs .
% uh we also have a new majestic , that 's three hundred , so we forget about that , right ?
% uh we have- the most affordable here , the attractive price is the keong saik hotel .
% uh and the other one is the inn at temple street .
% uh quieter side of chinatown is keong saik street .
% uh temple street you are actually % uh in the heart of % uh where people eat and % uh shop .
so it 's like you go downstairs and there are shops all around .
okay , so you want to be in the heart of the action but not along the main road , right ?
okay , so let me write this down , the inn at temple street .
and the name temple street is because there is one of our oldest hindu temples % uh over there .
so let me show you .
there you go .
if you want to book , alright ?
% uh when are you deciding to come ?
first week of april ?
% uh i think prices withhold , yes .
let me see .
is it the same set of prices ?
% uh it would goes up a little bit in april , % huh .
% uh thirty first of march , the price is one eight .
yah , one hundred so about twelve dollars more .
% uh that 's okay .
% uh you look at the price here .
so whether you are by yourself or with your friend , it 's the same price a hundred and thirty dollars .
so you can afford two nights .
right ?
yes , so that would be two hundred and sixty dollars .
but % uh there is no breakfast , you ha~ % eh it 's not a problem with breakfast , because you can always % uh just walk out as i said .
and you can have breakfast over there .
okay .
let me show you some % uh pictures and images of the hotel .
so that you have a better % uh idea of where you are staying , % huh .
so this is the outside , the facade of the hotel .
and this is the lobby .
so it 's quite homely , is n't it ?
yes , all the hotels along this little streets are converted shop houses .
% uh and well this may not be a shop house itself , it could be a clubhouse or whatever .
but % uh for the majority of the hotels , they are made up of buildings where peopl used to live upstairs and they run a business downstairs .
and it 's like it 's the same as your hotel , although i have n't check up on this particular address .
so the hoteliers % un undertook a conservation of the building by restoring it and- so the inside was changed .
% uh previously % uh there was one staircase leading down .
and there were very- it was very cramp .
there would be little cubicles where people live .
but , here you see it 's like a regular small boutique hotel .
so instead of the shop , you have a lobby , your reception area % uh as you enter .
yes , very classy .
so it 's quite a bargain for a hundred and thirty dollars , right ?
and from that little table and chair , they have tried to put some of the older furniture which has become very popular nowadays , % huh . so you can see the room has got a bathroom attached ?
right , so this is acceptable for you ?
okay , % uh would you like to see some of the food you can get ?
% uh in chinatown since you are not getting breakfast .
% uh what we like to eat in singapore which is % uh nutritious and tasty is called kaya toast .
% uh kaya is-
yah .
yes , kaya k a y a .
it is % uh- % uh i do n't know whether you can call it a jam .
it is made of % uh coconut .
% uh you know the flesh the coconut ?
we squeeze out the juice and then we put in eggs and % uh natural fragrance called pandans leaves .
so , it is cooked and it 's stirred constantly and in the old days this was done by hand .
i do n't know even now whether they have a machine to do it .
you can see it there % uh a shop that is very well known called yakun to-
yah .
% uh let me show you the picture here .
yah .
% uh can you see here spread the word ?
so they have made the recipe out of % uh coconut milk , sugar , eggs and pandan .
so it 's natural , no artificial colouring or flavouring .
the flavour is from the leaves .
and yakun is one of the most places .
in fact , i just had % uh their breakfast this morning .
and here it 's like a little café ,
nothing fancy but very affordable .
so you can put kaya on it or you can just put butter .
and we also like sugar on the toast
or cheese .
so instead of ham and eggs , or bacon and eggs , i think this is more traditional for us and maybe you want to try it .
yah , lucky i had lunch .
% uh here the bottom and they do it perfectly .
the eggs .
and what we do is we take it with dark % uh soy sauce .
you know soy sauce made from soya bean ?
so the dark kraft is very thick .
they use quality % uh dark soy sauce and if you like you can put in a lot of pepper .
% uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that 's , yes .
so i eat the whites and then i swallow the whole yolk , it 's very yummy .
but-
% oh yes , well , i do n't eat that everyday , % uh just a treat once in a while .
and % uh you- so to finish up , you can have the kaya on toast .
so you have it 's like a desert , you know what i mean ?
so you have the savoury eggs and then you have the sweet toast .
yes , ice cream toast .
% uh that would be maybe in the afternoon .
when it 's a bit warm so singaporeans get off the street , they want something to pamper themselves without spending too much , so they will % uh ask for ice cream toast , kaya toast or butter sugar .
have you tried that ?
you butter the toast bread and then you sprinkle sugar on it .
it 's not good for your diet but yummy .
no , you- yah .
just two days , you know % uh . % uh yakun outlets are all over singapore and you can find them in shopping centres , you can find them along the roadsides , you know , where you 're shopping .
% uh because it 's a chain .
the family has % uh opened up many outlets all over-
yah , so % uh what else would you like me to find for you % uh-
so you want the hotels in little india ?
okay , the beach one ?
alright , the sentosa hotels .
okay .
sentosa has % uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island .
and they also have resorts style very classy hotels .
so there is a choice .
in singapore we have lots of choices .
so you can always budget accordingly .
so that 's the view of the island and the beach is on one side of the island .
so % uh on the list there , you can see some % uh resort hotels .
you do n't want resort hotels , so you can % uh scroll down and find one % uh sentosa beach hotel .
let 's try and get the hotels again , okay .
it 's % uh loading now .
okay .
let me find it for you .
okay .
okay , there are two we can look at .
there is costa sands and there is also siloso beach .
so it 's on a popular beach with many attractions .
and here we have costa sands .
wait .
you 're having a view of the place ?
okay .
so costa sands , let 's look at the rates .
% uh let me see .
can you see up here ?
% uh just on the side bar , it 's eighty nine dollars to two hundred and fifteen dollars , yes .
so let me try and find it for you .
the two hundred over dollars a night would be i think a hotel room .
and there , can you see it here % uh . they have another hotel elsewhere .
so we have to make sure that we put you on sentosa island .
so you said april , do you have a date for april ?
okay .
okay , we get the april month for you .
april - % uh we have march there , we 'll get down to april .
yes , okay .
so the first of april is % uh sunday .
if it 's two nights you 'll stay till the third , is that right ?
or do you want to go another day in april ?
which da~ april seventh , okay , we 'll try for april seventh .
so it 's a weekend also .
april seventh and departing on the ninth , is that right ?
so it 's saturday till monday .
so you have the weekend there .
% oh i 'm sorry , they have no room .
to ba~ if you pick % uh a weekday , i think you 'll definitely get a room .
there is a , the calendar and then you can see the actual day you want to have .
april five that 's a thursday .
five in- and the seventh out , okay .
okay .
there are no room , % oh no rooms .
sorry , i looked at it , okay .
% uh i think your other friends have booked it already .
do you want to get , okay .
% uh , wait .
you try another date further down in april .
eleventh to thirteenth .
and we see whether you have luck this time .
so here , can you see the rates ?
% uh kampong hut is a small structure , it supposed to % uh resemble the % uh but you see the deluxe room , that 's a deluxe room that you are seeing over there .
okay .
so that is the difference .
some people prefer that % uh they go to the % uh kampong hut because of the nostalgic % uh feelings that it gives them .
% uh you have a look at it , the rooms have definitely air-conditioned for the % uh one that 's a hundred and eighty nine dollars .
kampong hut forty nine dollars , i 'm not sure .
% uh let 's see , okay ?
because forty nine dollars % uh is a little too attractive let say for a beachfront .
and also some people % uh they like to have the sea breezes .
i used to do that when i was % uh in school .
so you open the windows and you can hear the water , you can hear % uh the crickets in the background , you know .
so if you have air conditioning , you are actually shutting out the natural environment .
yes , so % uh for me because i like to go to as natural setting as possible , so % uh the kampong hut would be very attractive for me .
% uh i mean if i were the visitor .
but if you prefer creature comforts , you need your air conditioning , then % uh the hotel room will be more the regular type of hotel that you will be able to enjoy .
so % uh you can see that % uh there 's a swimming pool .
but of course i think you- perhaps want to swim in the sea .
the sea is very % uh calm , it 's a sheltered bay .
and for some people if they do n't like the salt water , then they can also use the pool .
yes , you can use both .
i think this is the kampong hut here .
okay .
yes .
so here it is .
they did n't mention air conditioning .
it seems like it may be .
i 'll try and find out for you .
i do n't know why it does n't say whether it 's air-conditioned or not .
but you see it 's all closed in .
you get what i mean ?
so % um
yes , probably it is .
% uh so % uh you still get your air conditioning , but i think the size of the place is perhaps a little bit smaller .
% uh , no . i think two people , if you 're not gon na spend a lot of time in the room , it should not be a problem .
okay , it 's air-conditioned .
% uh you get- what you get are two double-decker beds .
% uh and you also- okay , the only difference and this is the catch , you- there 's a common toilet and shower facilities nearby .
so you'll- yes , you have to share .
so in fact , the room is n't that small because you can have two double-decker beds and that means if you came with three other friends , you 'll still be able to stay there .
so some people on tight budget , that 's what they 'll do .
they save their money for shopping or eating .
yes , that is right .
that 's why , you know , the price is so low .
it is even under fifty dollars .
so what is your preference ?
% uh what-
you 're going with the deluxe room , okay .
so this is the deluxe room , % uh very classy , % huh ?
there .
so here you see the hotel .
so there 's the neighbouring carts .
okay , so the deluxe room - % uh let 's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room .
% uh the deluxe room then would give you more space , % uh more % uh comfort level .
and you also feel more like a tourist , okay .
we have to find out if it 's available .
was it eleventh ?
what date was it your-
yah , eleventh to thirteenth , okay .
eleventh to thirteenth .
okay , here you are , it 's a hundred and eighty nine dollars .
so that would be the standard deluxe .
% uh that 's okay .
so i can see you like some luxury .
we can put it at let 's say hundred and ninety dollars times two , % um that 's % uh three hundred and eighty dollars for your rooms , alright ?
and so then you 'll be on the beachfronts and there are forest walks that you can do there , okay ?
so we forget about little india and chinatown .
so what about sightseeing , what are your preferences ?
what sort of things that would you like to see whilst you 're here ?
% oh yes , % uh we have a botanic gardens that is very well-known .
and sentosa also has greenery all around .
% uh i 'll get you the information on the botanic gardens .
it 's the singapore botanic gardens .
and % uh it 's a huge place and most people % uh when they do n't have too much time , they visit the orchids , okay .
because the- within the orchid enclosure we have many- orchids that are in bloom , that are on display .
we also have a little forest % uh right near to where the orchids are .
and it 's a very % uh , what should i say ?
very comfortable forest because you can walk on a pathway and % uh you see huge trees over a hundred and fifty years old right next to you but % uh you do n't have to step on mud .
so it 's quite comfortable .
and we have also a ginger garden within the area .
and these areas are very near to each other .
so ginger 's % uh consist of eight families and some of them % uh they are grown for ornamental reasons .
so besides the ginger that you use for cooking , we have also , you know , colourful flowers that people use to decorate hotel rooms , % uh their own houses if they have a big % uh living room .
and so here you can see the gardens .
% uh you see the band stand there , that dates ?
right over a hundred years .
so we do n't have a band playing there now because it 's too small .
but , here you can see some of the attractions .
% uh let me show you , okay , the hours , the visiting hours .
% uh actually i know , it opens % uh five a.m . in the morning .
so- % oh yes , to the gardens , it 's free .
a very good news .
you just have to pay to see the orchids .
and % uh you- because that 's special , that 's very special , yah .
so i 'm talking about the national orchid garden .
it 's five dollars .
and this section closes at seven .
but you could go jogging around the garden till twelve midnight .
yes , % uh and you can go for romantic walk , you know , if you had bought your boyfriend along .
% uh but you and-
% uh % huh you can bring a girl .
maybe when you 're walking you 'll meet some ha~ a lot of handsome guys , you know , that live near the area ?
they go there and they jog and % uh so it 's nice also to have a look at other things besides the flowers there .
and we have , you know , senior citizens it 's only one dollar .
this is only if you see the orchids .
% uh if you are visiting the forest , the ginger garden , % uh ecological garden , it is all free of charge , yah .
% um , and your friend is an adult .
so you can not visit jacob ballas .
it 's a children 's garden .
% uh , okay .
% oh okay , if you are serious about botany , there is a very good library , okay .
% uh we can- this part of the gardens , you can approach by bus % uh and just walk there .
% uh to this area .
it 's very easy to visit .
now , let me show you the attractions .
we have there also % um very old tree .
% uh let me go to the tanglin halt .
okay , this is the map of the area .
so if you were to visit the gardens , % uh okay .
you could either stop your bus over here at tanglin gates , and then you walk in through a lovely garden here and then there is the lake and you can carry on , you can see the swans in the lake .
then you can carry on and % uh further down the walk would be the orchid enclosure , as well as the % uh ginger orchids .
if you want to see sculptures , you walk the other way .
we have some sculptures and we have huge % uh heritage trees .
can you see here this one called ceiba pentandra ?
that is actually the cotton tree , we call it the kapok tree .
and if you are lucky-
yes , it's- i do n't know if you are familiar with this when babies were born , we did n't want to give them polyester filled pillows , so there were people who collect % uh the cotton that is inside the pod and then it 's save up to make a pillow for the baby .
and the tree is very huge there and many people like to take photographs there .
so today it 's one of our heritage tree , so we try to protect it .
% uh further down is another tall tree here also a heritage tree .
and if you go around the corner , % uh can you see vanda 'miss joaquim ' ?
% uh that would be where the % uh ginger garden and the orchids is located , okay .
okay , so it 's nice to get in from there and then % uh you can see all the other parts of the gardens , and then this is the ginger garden .
can you see burkill gates ?
on the left ?
yah , so- lots of colourful % uh plants there .
and we also have useful gingers % uh turmeric , % uh the normal ginger that you eat .
and as you proceed up % uh it 's a very short road inside the gardens .
you see national orchid garden at the top ?
so that is where we have % uh the orchids .
and it 's a three-hectare site , you need about forty five minutes to visit the orchids alone to enjoy .
to take pho~ % oh yes , so % uh it 's because there's- it 's so interesting here , i think three quarters or an hour is the minimum to enjoy this .
so maybe if you provide % um three hours to go to the gardens , and , you know , you can also walk the forest .
the forest is just nearby .
and then you would have seen maybe only half of the gardens .
yah , so this is the biggest garden , the oldest and the most popular in singapore .
so ,
it 's also very chea~
it 's only just- it 's free , yes % uh . % uh i 'll show you some heritage trees or they have don't- let me see if there are pictures .
% oh this is just may be for scientist to know % uh the size of the tree and also where it 's located .
yah , so no pictures , not so interesting , okay .
so botanic gardens is a must see , yes ?
if you enjoy % uh gardens .
but we do n't have a sector on- let me see .
they do n't feature the forest .
let me try .
% oh bukit timah is not .
it 's not the attraction but let 's have a look at bukit timah .
okay here if you are interested in herbs and spices .
% uh it 's a further walk down to another section of the gardens and we have another lake there .
so here it 's % uh what we call an economic garden .
you can see nuts and beverages crops .
because originally when the british came , the gardens was used to experiment to see which spice trees , what useful plants could be grown here .
so we've-
yes , % uh the best-
% uh not nuts and fruits but % uh souvenirs like- but within the national orchid garden % uh we have a company called risis .
it i~ the first company to come up with the technology to encase a real flower and % uh preserve it .
so , % uh by some scientific method they have etched gold to the % uh real orchid flower .
and you can use it as a pendant or a brooch .
and of course that shop has other souvenirs as well .
but the spices % uh the herbs is more for educational purposes .
yah .
we have % uh plant sales but i think the gardens gets nurseries to sell their plants there .
so we also do research here .
so i think they not so keen on the commercial side of the business .
yah .
so this is the gardens for you .
what else would you like to see in singapore ?
is that all or you want to have % uh other areas % uh whether it 's museums or natural places ?
i can find for you .
zoos , okay , we try and get the zoo for you .
the zoo is part of a three attractions that is run by wildlife reserves in singapore .
so , here i 'm gon na open up and let you see .
also within the zoo % uh bird park and night safari which are the three attractions .
they are like gardens because of the landscaping .
but the landscaping is more towards the natural environment of the inhabitants .
so , like here were plants % um fruit trees for the birds , and tall shady trees and where the same trees are found in africa and can survive in singapore , we also got them .
this is % uh waterfall aviary , it 's a walk in aviary .
that means you actually can - you can be inside with the birds , you know what i mean ?
yes .
so % uh you can feel very close-up to them .
it 's not like you 're looking at the cage .
the birds are free flying .
and we also have the largest waterfall % uh that is man-made in this area which is also good for photography .
and if you are tired , you do n't want to walk , you can take % uh panorail which is an air-conditioned train within the park .
and as far as i know , it 's the only panorail that enters a bird aviary .
so when you get off the tram , you 're already inside this aviary .
and you can see the birds feeding , you can % uh wait .
if you map your tour according to the feeding times , you can feed them .
yah .
so this is the day attraction .
% uh you want to have % uh the % uh zoo , is that right ?
okay .
so the zoo is also a day attraction .
in other words it closes in the evening on about six o'clock .
and here we have- have you see this creature bef~
yes , i have n't seen it myself but i must go there just to see it .
% uh they call it naked , i think-
rats usually have fur , but this one does n't have fur .
and the teeth are used for tunnelling .
this is just one of the attractions there .
have you seen orangutans before ?
national geographic , yes .
well , here you can see % uh they are free-ranging , in other words , % uh up on the trees , they are swinging around and one of the highlights is % uh if you have breakfast -
it 's very safe because these are breed in the zoo .
and % uh they are tamed % uh .
, okay , so the restaurant you saw is air-conditioned if you are too hot you can go in and eat .
but it 's glass all around , so you can look out and you can see the orangutans .
their free-ranging area is right there .
so for twenty nine dollars % uh in the morning if you go , so the outside area is ah meng terrace named after an ambassador % uh who was an a female orangutan called ah meng .
and you 'd be able to have breakfast and at the same time you can- after your breakfast , take a photograph with the orangutan .
% uh they do n't really pose , they are sitting there .
and % uh i have n't seen an orangutan smile .
% uh but- yes , i know .
% uh if you are lucky there is a baby and then you can see % uh the mother and the baby .
so , if their baby is there , do n't touch the baby .
you know mothers are naturally protective of the babies .
so this is bigger picture .
so , the orangutan is nearby but it does n't care for your jam and rolls .
and it will have fruits like % uh bananas , durian .
do you know durian ?
they 're smelly but it 's very delicious , % uh very creamy and it will be eating that .
so after breakfast , you 'll be invited to take photos with the orangutan .
and they also now bring out other animals out % uh with their handlers .
so if you want to go near , % uh touch or take photograph , % uh you check with the handler and the handler will know the mood of the animal at that time .
usually they bring the ones that are very % uh visitor friendly .
so this is one of the things that you can see % uh at the zoo in the day time , yah .
% uh i 'll show you % uh the shows , let me see huh .
no , let me see the animal appearance .
okay .
there you go .
this is a very handsome python called the golden python .
and it 's with the handler , so % uh if you- % uh do you like snakes ? or are you-
% uh do you like snakes ? or are you-
so , you 're afraid them , you need not touch it but you-
it 's good to take this opportunity to just feel it , it 's very smooth , it 's cold .
no , they wo n't attack you , the keeper is there and in this picture you can see it is holding up , you know the snake quite well .
% um sometimes at the visitor sites , other visitor sites outside the zoo , we have % uh snake charmers who have their own cobras .
% uh and if you are afraid of touching the head , you can touch the tail .
that 's what some of my tourist do .
% uh sorry not cobra , i said the wrong thing .
phy- .
yes , no cobra , sorry .
we used to have what we called the black mamba that looks like a cobra , but they stop using that because the tourist % uh were frightened .
but % uh the mamba it 's actually a tame variety which the people bring in .
but at the zoo % uh they have the golden pythons , whose % uh habit is only to wind themselves around % uh you know , if they catch something they want to it , they wind themselves around it .
but you know this size especially , if they do say wind themselves around your hand , the keeper will be there to remove it .
so it 's not a problem , yah .
% uh let 's see if we can see other attractions .
here we go .
so you are looking at all the animals .
this is a family of orangutans .
we have crocodiles and monitor lizards .
and this is the australian outback .
okay let through .
these are the more exciting animals .
here we have the leopards and % uh we also have here elephants .
asian elephants who do a show and you can feed , you just pay a few dollars for the food , okay .
% uh fragile forest is where you can see- see this one you have to go to madagascar to see , so , yah .
this is also like the walking aviary .
it is a forest that you walk-in to .
there 's a huge net around it .
it 's a big area and as you 're walking around , you can take photographs of these animals , yah .
and these are fellows from africa , % uh baboons , himalayan hamadryas baboons .
we also have polar bears and there 's a polar bear show .
so , this one looks like the singaporean polar bear who was born here .
so he has air-conditioned surroundings , yah .
so these are some of the animals you see at zoo .
so does it attract you or ?
% hm yes .
yes . % uh ,
okay show one more to tempt you further .
this is % uh the most popular attraction because it is very rare .
it is a white tiger and it 's due to a mutant gene % uh found in indian and reproduced .
so % uh many people- see , not only the regular tiger but the white tiger , okay .
so % uh let me try to get you to the price of the night safari .
% uh sorry the price of the zoo % uh although we do have % uh package ticket where you see the several parks and you get some discount .
so , here we go .
i told you that it 's run by wildlife saf~ % uh reserves .
so we have % uh special pricing with discount built in .
if you visit two attractions % uh you get a discount .
see , if you visit the zoo alone , that is twenty dollars .
do you see there ?
% uh if you add-in the night safari it 's forty two .
and if you combine it with the bird park , it is thirty two .
so it 's only up to you , you know , % um how much time you have and % uh what you want to see .
yes , zoo botanic gardens % uh you can even do the night safari , it 's next to the zoo .
now , you can do a lot and you have a lot more money left % uh to do shopping .
% uh yes , that 's right .
yah .
% oh good % uh i hope i have been of help to you .
you 're very welcome jen and look forward to seeing you and your friend .
alright , bye .
see you , bye .
bye .
yes , goodbye , can you hear me ?
yes , okay .
okay .
hello , good afternoon .
four zero ?
and your name , sir ?
m a r l o w e , with an extra e ?
okay , i thought it 's like marlon brando .
my name is jeanne , j e a n n e and i 'm tour guide number two .
how may i help you marlowe ?
for~ % uh that 's the september period .
% uh you will be at the formula one to watch the races so i think it 's better if i get you % uh attractions that are near the formula one venue .
% ah but % uh do you want to settle where you want to live first , where you want to stay ?
okay , yes .
that 's very wise because if you take public transports % um some of the roads are closed off because it is % uh , what you call it ?
the approach roads to the venue .
okay , there is a beach road hotel and beach road is just adjacent to the race track and it 's very near .
and it 's you know , the public transport will also not be % uh passing by because i think they will not be allowed there because the road leads % uh into the race track area .
% oh yes , of course .
this hotel is not the high priced one .
there are high priced ones where % uh right on the race track .
% uh those prices % uh are much higher during the period of the race because that 's , you know % um-
yah and the people who are really keen on % uh the race some of them they do n't mind spending hundreds of dollars on it .
but here we have- % uh okay .
can you see on the screen ?
yes .
yes , that 's % uh it 's very sensible because it is % uh- you know in the same location as parkroyal and of course raffles hotel is eight hundred dollars that 's a five-star .
yah okay .
reach , yes .
do you have the dates or do you want us to find the dates for you the formula one race ?
yes .
usually it 's % uh last weekend i think it 's the third weekend at the end of the month .
% uh it is the twenty first , twenty second and twenty third .
for this year , okay .
% um okay .
% uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it 's near impossible it will be fully booked already .
yah .
so % uh if you book now here it says a hundred and thirty dollars book this .
% uh when are you- i mean how are you travelling ?
are you with a friend or are you coming alone ?
okay .
so it 's just one single room huh ?
% uh it 's actually the same price if you see here .
because they are not supplying a breakfast .
so let see if % uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds .
okay .
september - you want to come in on the twenty first ?
% uh yes , that 's ideal .
yes .
you could even walk around , you know and have a look at the place .
and so you can in fact leave on the twenty fourth morning .
i think at-
because that would be after the race .
okay , 2012 .
and you only want one room , right ?
okay .
so let 's have a look .
we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or % uh what sort of price .
they have put there normally that 's % uh you know it 's a hundred and thirty dollars if you book now .
so % uh-
yes .
in singapore we are very greedy nation , we are eating all the time .
% uh okay .
there 's a market that is % uh very near you within walking distance and if i walk the same distance because when i go by bus my bus stop somewhere near there .
and % uh there you can get % uh local food .
% uh i 'm not sure if i can get you- % uh whether they have % uh a website because this- it 's what we used to call a hawker centre but we do n't have hawker centre % uh so it 's called a food centre and it 's called the beach road .
okay .
yes .
% uh around the hotel also % uh there are places that you can come out and eat and if you want something in an air-conditioned place there 's also a food centre % uh nearby at raffles city which is a big convention and exhibition centre .
but you know many people work there and % uh they ca n't afford to be , you know going out to markets to look for food .
so at these food centres you 'll get decent food , local food and at affordable prices .
yah .
% uh i do n't know about cheaper price but % uh i know that during the race % uh % uh they do have vendors % uh offer their souvenirs .
% uh because in singapore we protects % uh copyright so i 'm not sure that you can get % uh sort of like imitation of the real stuff .
you wo n't be able to get it i do n't think so .
% uh the market i 'm talking about it does n't have % uh a website but i can describe to you what they have there .
yes .
% uh let me see beach road .
% um % hm , let me see .
oops , sorry .
% uh i ca n't see .
no , i think they are attractions .
they are places- i do n't see the key here .
does it say ?
no it 's urban development authority so it 's not a bus stop , okay ?
but your market is just down the way .
your hotel is where this little % uh like % uh exclamation mark is .
so you walk down here and % uh at sultan gate palace we have the oldest mosque in singapore you can visit .
and if you want non-souvenir % uh non~ sorry , non-race souvenirs you can do shopping along arab street .
this whole area is a conservation area .
and just beyond sultan gate is the market that i 'm talking about .
do you know % um satay or kebab ?
are you familiar with kebab ?
it's- a kebab is meat that is skewered and-
alright .
so our version of it here in % uh southeast asia is satay , we called it s a t a y .
and here you can see the vendors- they have different kinds of meats .
% uh these are at beach road you get the % uh malay version of it with peanut sauce .
and so you would n't be getting any pork satay you would be getting % uh chicken , beef and % uh mutton .
okay .
if you like spicy % uh there are other spicy dishes i can introduce you .
these are more sweet , they are usually marinated to be sweet .
and the sauce is peanut sauce gravy , you see the little bowl that is there ?
and you eat it with rice that has been cooked and- traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it .
but sometimes they put it in a tube and then it comes out sort of circular form and it sliced up .
now you also get % uh- sorry you were gon na say ?
yah .
okay on the last picture here on the- at the top can you see slices of cucumber ?
and % uh fresh onions .
so if- since you are travelling alone you are not gon na offend anybody , that 's not very sweet , okay .
so-
% uh so this is one of the favourite dishes % uh and you can eat there .
yah .
okay .
yes .
% uh because the flyer is located % uh within view of the race track and % uh the flyer is % uh very slow moving .
so you get % uh time to soak in the view not only the race track but the surrounding area .
if i am % uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars .
yes .
i 'll show you the location of it .
so can you see it here ?
and the race track is just nearby .
yes .
% uh if you % uh do n't mind walking you can walk there , you know .
it 's nice to walk because % uh it 's by the river and it's- lots of things to see and % uh enjoy while you 're % uh doing your walk .
uh-
i 'm a walking sort of tourist , okay .
gon na show you the flyer now .
okay .
so you 're seeing just a little bit of it at the corner there .
% uh this advertisement they are trying to encourage you to % uh take in a tour but here- there you can see .
you can- the butler of course this one is % uh not so cheap huh .
fifteen dollars if you can prove you 're a student but % uh i do n't think you 're a student , right ?
are you ? % uh-
% uh not anymore .
so marlowe i 'm afraid you have to pay % uh twenty nine dollars % uh .
you have-
% uh singapore sling is a cocktail that was concocted at the raffles hotel .
it 's got gin , angostura bitters and- you know if you pay extra you can enjoy your meal or you can have % uh a drink .
yah , so i think- yah so you just be prepared to pay a little bit more .
there are places where you can eat there .
% uh this is- wait a minute .
wait .
% uh so this is the cocktail flight .
you are given the cocktail but it is not the singapore sling it 's their own .
i think they have created something else green in colour .
because the % uh singapore sling is pinkish red in colour .
so you 're looking at the capsule now .
yes , that 's right .
so there are restaurants around the area .
there is % uh place where you can buy things .
so-
yah .
so dining on the flyer i think this is chilli crab , let me try and get it for you .
because you say you like something hot , right ?
% uh , one of our iconic dishes here that many people like to eat is chilli crab .
yah you enjoy crabs , right ?
you do n't have any allergy or anything ?
% uh it is crabs cooked with chilli and % uh what do you call it ?
% um tomato sauce .
and if you do n't mind eating with your fingers i always recommend that it 's finger licking good .
% um , yah .
so seafood paradise .
that 's where you can % uh have it .
oh we are getting % uh sound .
no . it 's a restaurant .
we 'll try and cancel this .
yah , that's-
alright , okay .
yah .
okay .
we have got % uh- this level one is about the area where the flyer is .
do you want to see anything else ?
% oh then i recommend the raffles hotel because that is a very historic hotel .
% uh that is a national monument and-
so- usually it 's the british who know about this hotel because they were our colonial rulers before independence .
but this hotel here people often go in and take photographs .
% uh and we have there a place called the long bar .
where the reception of the hotel is now , % uh it 's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel and it was the longest bar in the whole world at one time .
okay .
but-
yes .
they have lots of mixes but the people who go there % uh they go for the singapore sling
because the sling was created there at the hotel
by their bartender .
yes , that 's right .
so you 're getting it % uh from the place itself it 's very special .
you can even buy the glass to bring home .
yes .
and they- they wo n't sort of clean up your glass and give it to you they give you a new one % uh nicely packaged .
yes we have a zoo it is out of town but because of where you 're staying near the % uh subway station
you can take the subway and then you can connect .
% uh yes , that would be very easy .
but just let me show you the zoo first because it 's coming out from the screen .
it 's in the north of singapore and where the race is held is in the south of singapore .
but you can connect % uh to the nearest big town and there you take a bus that will bring you directly to the zoo where the few stops along % uh housing areas .
so it 's also a good opportunity for you to see the type of housing singaporeans live in , the scenery of , you know the natural neighbourhoods that you see .
you will not be in the business area when you take this bus that connects you % uh from the % uh train station to the bu~
% uh zoo .
'cause the zoo is where not many people live it is in % uh a reserve that is % uh to help us to collect rain water .
it 's next to a reservoir and that 's why it is so attractive .
yes there is also a night safari % uh but you will be watching your show , right ?
so it 's either the night safari or you 're gon na see your race .
% oh yah .
watch the race and either you extend the date or you come back another time for it .
yes , that 's a good idea .
let me just show you % uh some of the attractions .
so what we do is we plan it so that it 's not only the animal on show you get a little bit of the natural environment .
this is part of % uh the australian outback , so we 've got wallabies there .
we 'll go through quickly so i can tell you about the % uh the card that you asked me about .
cat country .
do n't they look loveable ?
and i think these are mousedeers , huh .
they are-
have you seen them before ?
yah , they are very cute they are the size of % uh little rats but they are actually look like deer .
so it 's called a mousedeer .
and- the enclosure is just at the entrance so it 's very near for you to see .
then we have elephants .
% uh i thought you knew it more than % uh i thought you did .
it's- i should n't tell you because % uh actually it 's during the show .
% uh so if you sits at a certain place you might get a little bit of a shower , that 's all .
they do n't spray at you all the time not to worry .
they are- they do- % uh the show is not doing tricks . it 's just-
% uh the show is not doing tricks . it 's just- naturally they heave heavy logs in some countries so they are like work elephants .
so here their mahouts which is the name of their trainer help them- teach them you know how to continue doing this so that people will understand .
and here-
mahouts is the name of the handler .
yah , that 's the term .
these are % um lemurs that you naturally have to go to madagascar to see .
and the industries called fragile forest which is % uh a forest area that 's encased in netting .
so we also have some free flight birds there and butterflies .
it 's a very lovely setting for photography .
yes , a very large memory .
so you know because animals move around and so if you % uh want you can click as many as you like with them doing different things .
% yah , okay .
here we have some baboons , they are hamadryas baboons .
so the environment is not forest it 's like hilly .
they have multiplied a lot and do n't be afraid if they come at you .
there 's a place that 's % uh covered and with glass .
so if you do n't want to see them in the open where you 're protected by a mode , you go to the glass covered area .
and if the male baboon thinks you look like % uh somebody who will court his wife he will come charging at you .
yah , it 's quite exciting because % uh you know it 's so near but you are protected by the glass so it 's fun .
% uh sometimes- no , i would n't recommend that you do , yah .
% uh so the zoo is precautious it will not % uh take any risk with anybody .
orang-utans in the wild if you see them also do n't go near them because they have very- they are very strong .
but once in the zoo some of them have been bred here they are singapore citizens .
so- % uh at the breakfast show you can take photographs with them .
and they 're in a % uh open area so they are swinging from tree to tree very near you .
you can also take photos with them .
you will just pay a small fee .
so have you seen polar bears before ?
so you do n't have to go to a cold place and you can see the polar bear and % uh still be in the equatorial area .
% uh there 's a show in the morning and you can see him catching fish and al- so hitting a ball high up so they have been trained .
of course they have an air-conditioned area where they can sleep if they like .
this is one of the handsome occupants of primate kingdom .
sure .
% uh you will be able to because in the primate kingdom again it 's open but % uh the animals are in separate islands so that the species do not mix .
and they have % uh water mode is that little islands within an area and they have trees where they can climb up and down .
so over the years they have decided that well this is my house and i 'm happy i wo n't leave it because they have % uh free lodging , free medical facilities .
% uh the only thing is they do n't know how to smile at you .
yes .
the only thing is do n't be enthusiastic and jump over if you are a long jumper .
% uh you should n't be able to get through % uh because if you enter any of these % uh areas then the animals are likely to be defensive because you are encroaching on their home .
% uh okay .
yah .
so if you go you must take picture of this one it 's a proboscis monkey .
this one is in a different environment because it comes from the forest of borneo it 's very shy .
i saw it for thirty seconds in its natural environment when i went over to borneo .
so they gave us some and they have bred successfully .
and the thing is % um you see this % uh nose hanging down ?
for the male the nose grows long , it hangs down and for some reason the females think the longer the nose the handsomer he is .
% uh yes , that 's right .
and the proboscis there fore refers to the length of the nose .
if they are breeding at the time you may see a female with % uh baby and that 's really thrilling .
% uh no , they are not shy yah .
lots of tourists have taken photographs of them .
i think they get used to the environment .
you 're not going to kidzworld so i will skip that .
% uh do you like snakes ?
% uh are you-
okay , you just want to see them .
we have a reptile garden .
% uh yah , it 's within the area where we have crocodiles , % uh % uh monitor lizards and % uh komodo dragons .
if i 'm not mistaken this is a komodo dragon % uh normally found in some islands in indonesia .
but there is also an area where you can see snakes .
% uh it- it is fully enclosed so you choose whether you want to go in .
so if you enter through the gate you 'll find snakes coiled around tree trunks and you can take photographs .
no they specially select these % uh snakes so the species is specially selected .
so you you walk on a wooden walkway and- % uh so it 's quite fun .
suddenly you make a turn and there you have a snake right on- you know , nearby .
% uh and then you just walk out- % uh you enter by one gate and you enter- you exit by another .
safe , very safe .
% uh if i can go through it anybody else can .
% uh so this is african region with lions .
yah .
so even if you % um do n't walk you can see the lions if you just take a tram right around .
the lions- we have quite a few i forget how many but some of them maybe in a place that 's % uh good for photos , yah .
if not you can walk in the same area after you get off the tram and then you can % uh walk and position yourself .
and you must not leave the zoo without seeing this .
this is not the regular tiger , this is- % uh special species is the white tiger .
and it was found years ago in india .
yes .
% uh and one day they found one that was white % uh he had gene mutation and % uh maharaja or the ruler he started breeding them .
and then when the offspring came out , you know maybe half white half yellow , they- it- they continue to breed until they got the white gene being % uh predominant .
so we have three of them .
they are in an area where they have a deep pool .
so sometimes you can see them swimming .
besides the orang-utans these are very popular with % uh tourists .
yah so your camera- you do n't forget your camera you 'll be enjoying .
yah , that 's right .
so % uh the zoo is really % uh a must-see place i feel for people .
yah .
okay .
this zoo you have to take a train it 's a little bit further away , okay ?
so i 'm going to find you other attractions .
% uh what are- what would you consider visiting , a museum or an outdoor area ?
universal studios , yes okay we can try and get universal studios % uh and get you some pictures .
this is on sentosa island it 's % uh not so near that you can walk .
you 'll have to take % uh bus and also % uh take a shuttle of the outside of universal studios go into sentosa island .
so you take a bus % uh from near your hotel and i think if you ask the hotel concierge they 'll be able to tell you where the- in fact i can tell you .
you- if you walk to the raffles hotel if you had your sling , around the corner of raffles hotel % uh facing raffles city which is the convention centre , % uh there 's a bus number one three one and it will take you to a place called harbourfront .
can you see on the map here ?
so harbourfront here .
you get off the % uh bu~ the- sorry , the train - the bus stop in fact .
and in fact if you wait there , there are shuttle buses free of charge that will bring you into universal studios .
you do n't have to take the sentosa bus that will cost you an extra dollar because here % uh universal studios is very happy to have you % uh visit them , okay .
alright .
yes % uh but i 'm not going to show % uh all the rides .
you can just see here ?
just a picture , this is easier to see .
it 's % uh- you know if you like thrills and scares .
okay .
% uh lots of places to amuse you .
% uh this is the transformer , the ride you know you will be % uh having the thrill of your life % uh as you are you know % uh moving around .
let me just go through % uh what they have here .
so if rides you 're interested in % uh-
they have the battlestar galactica % uh cylon .
so it 's a suspended roller coaster goes up around and upside down .
you like that ?
okay , here 's more .
% uh intense corkscrews and cobra roll .
% uh okay .
% uh that 's really fun % huh .
we also have % uh battlestar galactica choose your side human versus cylon .
and you have the- you engage in the ultimate intergalactic battle between good and evil at world 's tallest duelling roller coasters themed after hit tv show battlestar galactica .
% uh so % uh- it 's also ancient egypt , mummies and obelisk .
so you are transported back % uh eighty years to the nineteen thirties to the golden age of egyptian exploration .
% uh here % uh you can face the wrath of the mummy on the world 's first psychological thrill ride .
total darkness .
% uh on all sides you get huge fire balls , swarms of scarab beetles and an army of warrior mummies .
so % uh-
so it 's adventure all the way for you , you know .
yah .
% uh that- yes .
% uh i can see % uh how you will be very excited because i 've also been to the disneyland and % um % uh to the universal studios , yah and really % uh engaging .
yah .
% uh i think you 'll get the most adventure here already % uh at universal studios .
% hm , playing football you have to hook up with % uh the local teams i do n't information on that because football is played % uh- it 's a team game , right ?
so % uh off-hand now i would not be able to tell you but % uh if you asked your travel agents % uh and- to source for you or % uh we have more time to look into the internet and we contact % uh a clubs or schools that are willing to entertain you then you will be able to .
but % uh you will not have time i think , you know because % uh-
yah .
for the family % uh do you want to shop at % uh this resort , the resorts world singapore ?
or do you want , you know % uh simpler % uh souvenirs say from chinatown or from % uh the shopping centres ?
yes .
bags and shirt you can get in chinatown % uh easily .
yes .
you can go down to chinatown and % uh % uh you 'll be able to get bags and shirts very easily .
% uh along the street side .
% uh and prices are also affordable so you can buy more , you know more variety .
% uh you can take the train from city hall station .
okay , do you see the red line ?
so beach road is just % uh nearby okay .
and- so if you- at city hall you can take- let me see what 's the easiest connection , well either way .
you can go to dhoby ghaut .
this is a major intersection with three lines meeting .
and then you take the purple line which is the northeast line and it 's just two stops down to chinatown .
okay .
so that 's where you can get a variety of % uh things to buy .
i 'll try and see if i can get you some photos % uh some photos so you 'll have a better idea .
% uh phones or tablets - phones you probably can buy- i ca n't tell you exactly the shops but i think i 've seen phone shops there .
but if you 're talking about information technology % uh there is a centre in singapore where you have % uh a lots of these shops so it would be easier for you to pick and choose down there and it is called funan centre .
yes .
it 's also very near to % uh your hotel .
so let me show you funan centre .
people get it products , peripherals .
i like that . that 's where % uh singaporeans go .
i like that . that 's where % uh singaporeans go .
% uh so here you are at city hall .
you can in fact walk .
you sound like a strong young man , right ?
so- yes .
so if you walk down % uh to- % uh let me see if i can get the map here .
okay this is a picture of the store .
% uh we have buses and we have % uh-
i think if you do n't want to walk you can take a bus .
yah .
yes .
so the funan place where you can do your shopping is here and your hotel is , okay to the right there .
can you see % uh beach centre -
yes , that 's near .
that 's why i say it 's in fact walkable % uh because then you can take in the sights along the way .
% uh you can see % uh the saint andrew 's cathedral which is % uh historic monuments .
and % uh nearby % uh if you divert a little bit it 's the first church built in singapore that 's still is % uh more or less in its original form with add-ons it 's called the armenian church .
so as you walk you get to see more % uh % uh than you would if you % uh hop up a bus .
it 's not very far i mean i could walk the distance , yah .
so in the day before the race you have lots of things to occupy you , yah .
% um hm .
% uh i think if you are in this area and you 're willing to walk you will be able to see attractions as you 're walking .
% uh so if you walk a little bit further down here you see the singapore river ?
so the race track is here , okay % uh around here .
this is the singapore river .
% uh there are bars and restaurants here it 's very scenic .
and if you were to % uh move down a little bit more-
if you turn this way towards the marina bay it 's the merlion park .
okay , % uh i do n't know if you heard of the merlion .
it-
% uh it 's the first emblem of the singapore tourism board when it was started .
half lion and half % uh fish because we 're an island .
% uh but we have no lions in singapore .
we have no record of lions naturally born in singapore so perhaps he saw a tiger which used to roam in our forest or a big deer , yah .
so this is a place many tourist like to go % uh to take photographs as % uh you can see some of the tourist there .
% uh otherwise if you- then if you- after you have taken your photographs you can head back along the river and % uh go down towards funan .
and from funan you carry on walking you will be in chinatown area .
% oh yes , the best pair of sneakers that you have % uh so- you know you are comfortable .
yes .
or you can take a break every now and then along the way .
stop at a coffee shop and you can have a drink that many of us enjoy .
% uh we- do you drink coffee or tea ?
yes cold .
so % uh we too like it cold .
you can have it with % uh evaporated milk and % uh you can add ice to it so it 's called % uh kopi-si .
can you remember that ?
or you can just tell him with ice % uh yah .
yah , they will understand .
si means you 're adding evaporated milk so it makes it really yummy .
yes you can have % uh bread and toast with it if you like .
% uh you can have a kind of jam made of coconut milk and % uh sugar and pandanus leaves .
are you familiar with pandanus leaves ?
yah .
so it 's a fragrant jam that we put inside it 's called kaya toast .
kaya is the name of the jam .
and if you like it you can buy it home as a souvenir also .
you just have to pack it carefully .
% oh no . it does n't stink in fact it 's very fragrant because of the pandanus .
yah .
so you can get it in jars like this , yah .
so we have the description there .
and ya kun here is a very old % uh shop with a long history and now they have opened little cafés all over singapore .
it 's very affordable .
and they have cheese toast they have toast with % uh butter and sugar , with kaya .
and if you want some more nutrition you can have soft boiled eggs .
% uh they do it perfectly .
yes .
in fact i just had it this morning .
eighty cents for one egg .
because i did n't want to eat too many .
yah .
yes .
so % uh you- this is something % uh local that you can try .
here are some pictures of it .
% uh it's-
alright .
if it is very hot you can settle for ice cream toast .
i think that 's a modern add-on .
% uh the traditional is the kaya toast the one in the first picture top left .
so if your sneakers are getting tired you can give your sneakers % uh a rest .
yes , that 's right .
and it 's perfectly done , really perfectly done .
i can not get it done this way .
you know sometimes you get it with these transparent parts that are supposed to be white but here % uh they are all white .
i think it 's the temperature was there , water and the fact that the eggs are very fresh .
% uh no because- if you look at the side bar here on the left can you see franchise opportunities ?
you have to pay them a lot of money to learn the secret .
if you like pork - do you like pork ?
% uh as you 're walking in that area there is also % uh pork .
% uh % uh what we like to eat is % uh pork bones in soup that you can % uh try and it 's also a coffee shop just down from the river near to where your stall is .
yah .
and it 's got a lot of garlic inside so the garlic is also yummy .
that 's a good thing about travelling alone you do n't have to worry about you know smelling stinky or your girlfriend or your companion is going to scold you .
yes .
so this is the chinese version further down % uh they 're showing you some of the ingredients .
% uh no , this is not spicy this is garlic % uh alright .
% oh but normally people put lots of pepper in it .
that there- yes .
so it 's a spicy- so they- normally a lot of restaurants now leave the spicy options to you so that it 's optional .
% uh it 's optional so that you can % uh put it or you can not put it in .
yes ?
okay .
yah .
% uh any other things you 'd like to know besides the shopping , chinatown and % uh and the food to eat .
yes , indeed .
remember to book early because that is a very popular period .
okay .
% yah , good luck .
you are most welcome and i look forward to seeing you here , marlowe .

that will be fine if you are coming during the weekend but otherwise a- the whole month is actually okay if you try to come somewhere around in % uh the ninth onwards because % um sixth and seventh is actually a peak .
% uh in singapore here around the clock- around the day is- everyday is % uh actually % uh busy with a lot of tourists .
yah .

you have to take a train .
% um the-
yah .
the train system which will take you from % uh universal studio to-
% uh , yah .
no , you have to change buses or you can also take direct buses % uh which is bus service number one hundred from harbourfront which is harbour- front near to universal studio .
% uh buses wise you 'll be out the most around about an hour .
but i will suggest to you if you are going for universal studio then you probably need a full day there to enjoy yourself .
yah .
shopping ?
alright .
shopping , one of the most famous shopping street in singapore is known as orchard road which had-
% uh one of the most famous shopping street in singapore is known as orchard road .
yah .

yah .
% uh on the screen you wan na see ?
okay .

% oh , % uh these are some of the photos about orchard road , yah .
is not that .
actually % uh on orchard road we have a lot of premium % uh shops and they sell goods like louis vuitton , versace , prada , you know , all these premium goods % uh can be found-
yes , signature item .
correct .
but if you- yah .
paragon is also % uh part of the orchard road as you can see from the screen itself and many of the nice hotels are also located there like in the hyatt which is along the scotts road which is also a part of the orchard road .
or marriott hotel also one of the nice hotel located-
yah .
located along orchard road .
an hour or two ?
% uh you mean % uh a few hours of resting or what ?
a few hours on- for resting ?
the cheap~ well , i say along orchard road you hardly can find some % uh budget hotel % uh there but % uh somewhere near to orchard road you probably will be able to get one .
i think it 's hotel eighty one which is at bencoolen .
yah .
yah , certainly .
just give me a minute and i 'll give you hotel eighty one .
yah , % hm .
right .
% uh one of the-
yah .

nature trip , if you like flowers we do have a botanical garden which is located % uh somewhere near to the city area .
% uh very nice % uh we have some national flowers which are located inside the % uh national orchid garden which is als~ % uh which is near to the city area .
the % uh-
animals will be in the zoo .
a zoo will be a nice place to visit as well .
yes .
now , you are asking me about the hotel % uh hotel eighty one along orchard road .
this is the hotel on the screen .
yah , where it 's located .
well , the rate is here .
you can-
yah , you can check the rate from-
yah .
yes , indeed .
so if you are looking at-
and you can it 's % uh ninety three dollars if you are staying for the ni~ for the whole night if not then you probably have hourly basis usually is about two hours of rest .
they probably will charge you % hm approximately around about fifty to sixty dollars .
yah .
yah .
% uh hotels here is actually a budgeted hotel mainly for % uh taking rest % um a stop over .
yah , sort of things .
% uh certainly .
yah , i 'm always , % uh . i 'm happy- i 'm always happy to have you here .
and you can see from the map here % uh this is where the hotel is located , % uh .
% uh it 's along orchard road here .
% uh sorry .
yah .
from the % uh- % uh from universal studio you can take in system .
train system is also available % uh at this hotel here .
it does walk towards little india .

you can take from here and leads you all the way to % uh harbourfront there are where the % uh train will come to a stop where you can % uh take the sentosa express into universal studio .
yah .
% uh night safari .
night safari is also a nice place to visit as well .
% uh it 's in fact is something like a zoo but instead it's- instead of a day zoo it 's actually a night zoo .
something really a little bit different and of course % uh singapore is one of the first to introduce such night zoo in the world .
yes .
certainly , yah .
yes , certainly .
but of course % uh during the night time when you are taking the light on % um the % uh night safari of course % um flash photography is not allowed .
yah .
yes .
most of the- % uh they are not in the cage .
in fact % uh the night safari has been designed in a way and that % uh the animals are actually are on their own % uh premises but you does n't have the feel that it was in a cage .
% uh there is a certain things that we have put in place so that the animals will not % uh escape from their premises .
% uh they-
feeding them-
i 'm sorry .
that % uh is not possible because % uh to ensure the visitor 's safety we usually take a very good precaution against % uh-
% uh that 's a black tapir .
elephant and- % uh it 's not an anteater .
% uh it looks like an anteater but the anteater has a little bit longer % uh nose .
% uh yah .
yes , we do have restaurants .
you can see as % uh on the- at the dining area we do have buffet which is also available in ulu ulu % uh restaurants .
this is % uh some of the- % uh we have a buffet , we also do have the alacarte , indian food and chinese , % uh mediterranean .
% uh everything is almost available there as well .
because you see it is a screenshot of the bongo burgers which is part of the % uh restaurants .
% ah , and if you like to enjoy your meal % uh in the night safari while you are taking the tram is also available .
yes .
you can see on your screen itself you can see chilli crab which is one of our % uh favourite dishes here in singapore .
% uh no . % uh bongo burgers % uh those are a little bit of- where % uh they are mainly more to the western food .
yes .
we do have three restaurants which are there .
the % um ulu ulu which is % uh-
this is ulu ulu as you can see it from your screen right now .
it 's a buffet style and also alarcarte .
% uh bongo burgers is another one but if you really like some % uh quick fussy food like kfc % uh you have to be a little bit early because the % uh kfc usually close at seven , yah .
so you have to pack your food before that time .
so if you like some nice ice cream we also do have ben & jerry 's which is also located in the premises of the night safari .
yah , ben & jerry ice cream .
very famous .
they have various type of taste and various type of flavours as well .
yah , you can see it from your screen right now .
it is .
we- if you ca n't finish it up you probably can ask for the smaller one which is about one or two scoops , yah .
yah .
well , you- % uh so for your two-day tour in fact % um the-
if you really like the theme park one of them is , you know , universal studio as i recommend .
if not then you probably would like to have the beach .
sentosa also do have some nice beaches as well .
% uh not white beach but a nice beach .
yah .
romantic places ?
% oh , okay .
for dating ?
right .
% uh in fact % uh we also do have some nice dining area like % um the singapore flyer which is one of the world largest observation wheel .
yah , you can also have some % uh good romantic dinner out there .
there you are .
you can see it from here .
% hm , singapore flyer .
no . singapore flyer is actually like the % uh london eye .
it 's an observation wheel which takes % uh visitors up for a ride % uh so that they can have a good- a nice view of the whole sort of- part of singapore .
no . it 's actually a wheel- a big giant wheel .
% uh you can see- let me see what i-
yes , like a ferris-
yah , ferris wheel .
% uh the singapore flyer in fact is standing at the height of one hundred and sixty five metre .
% uh no . in fact you wo n't not feel the height at all when you are taking the ride .
you do n't even feel that the wheel is moving at all .
you have fear- % uh okay .
okay .
% uh then % uh-
you 've some problem on the computer ?
% uh what about east coast beach ?
east coast beach is also a nice place .
yah .
% uh yes .
we do have some cables- % uh cable skis which is available at that area .
% uh yah .
we have .
like % uh- you see the nice beaches ?
% uh that 's the east coast bridge .
you can also do cycling along the beaches .
yah .
we do have % uh bicycle for rental .
you can take the bicycle % uh and take a ride along the beach % uh will- probably will cost you around by eight dollars an hour .
you see we also have % um family games .
during the weekend especially there will be a lot of crowds which are there .
yah .
food wise % uh you can also cycle and get some nice % uh food- our local food especially at the nearby hawker centre .
yah , this is the cable ski that i 'm talking about that you can see- it 's a actually a cable which take them around on the east coast % uh lagoon .
yah .
it 's not % uh wind- % uh wind surfing boarding is also available % uh at the east coast park .
% uh yes , % uh if you plan a-
the schedule % uh properly you should be able to do it .
probably on the first day if you a- what do you have in mind ?
you are like some beaches or you like some theme park or you like some zoo ?
so that i can help you to plan out accordingly so that you can have a nice % uh , you know , holiday here with your girlfriends .
if you have to say from the airport you do not have enough time .
east coast which will be a nice place to hop in .
yes .
east coast beach , if the nearest the next one will be singapore flyer .
if you are afraid of height then you probably would like to try sentosa which is also- which a nice place to visit .
or you can also go to the merlion park .
okay .
% uh now-
yah .
% uh why do n't in this way ?
maybe on the first day when you arrive i would like to say is that % hm you can try to stay in a hotel near to % uh this- in the city area .
% uh probably at the one that i suggested % uh near to the city area .
then if you want something cheap % uh that would be about ninety dollars a day .
you can see from the internet .
and from there you can actually walk down towards merlion park which is about- approximately about fifteen minutes or you can take a bus there as well .
then % uh from merlion park then if you have additional time probably you like to do some % uh shopping % uh along that particular way .
% uh ninety dollars is per room per night .
% uh there is only two bed dens inside there or they call it twins sharing .
yah .
then probably the second day if you prefer to % uh catch % uh the universal studio % uh that will be able to fully occupy your two days in singapore .
but if you like nature then you probably should try the zoo if you do n't like the theme park .
okay .
% uh alright .
okay .
for the rides here i can show it to you what they have to offer here in % uh resort world .
there .
so these are the transports available that you can go by train , by bus , % hm .
it 's % uh- this is % uh-
the sentosa park and what they have to offer let me just go and pick it out for you , alright ?

in fact it 's really required % uh one complete full day to be % uh completing the whole % uh theme park .
the theme park operates from morning at % uh nine thirty .
% uh they will start at nine thirty then % uh they finish their business around by seven .
after seven it 's purely mainly for shopping .

it 's not really very big .
it 's % uh just a small little fountain there % uh small little waterfall there we have .
% uh that 's for decoration .
% uh it 's not that as i say .
% uh if you want % uh to have a good , nice holiday come during the weekdays it will be good .
if you want to come during the weekend then you probably have to % um- have a little bit more time on waiting for your attractions .
yes .
in fact in universal studio there is a limit for the % uh people visiting inside the universal studio .
% uh approximately about eight thousand visitors a day .
maximum- yah .
yes .
yah , they have a crowd control there so % uh they if they exceed the number of % uh visitors they will probably have to close the gate .
% uh security wise we do not have se~ % uh much issue on that % uh usually inside universal studio we do have lockers available .
for every attractions there are lockers available which is % uh for the first half an hour is free but anything after that is chargeable .
universal globe is actually outside of the universal studio in resort world .
you can probably also can take some nice photograph of the globe .
the merlion in sentosa is actually known as the merlion tower .
it 's actually not called merlion % uh- it 's a merlion tower in fact .
not mer~
yes .
yah , i 'll show it to you right now .
you see that is the merlion tower .
yah .
it 's a huge tower which a- there 's a lift taking % uh the visitors up to the tower % uh right all the way up to the lion mouth and also to the lion head .
then % eh % hm where the- hang on i 'll just help you see the price of this merlion .
correct , merlion .
% uh cable car is % uh just hang on , huh .
it 's actually % hm-
these are some of the attractions available in sentosa other than the one % uh in % uh resort world .
resort world is part of sentosa but is on the other side of sentosa which has separate admission ticket .
sentosa is % uh another attraction which is located inside % uh far from- % uh sentosa is actually the full island but the resort world is part of sentosa .
yah .
so these are the attractions available inside the sentosa island .
yah .
palawan beach as i say if you like the beach that would be also a nice place to go .
it 's inside sentosa island .
% uh four d magix in fact is a ride .
it 's a four d % uh movie ride .
yah , it 's a movie ride .
you can see it from here .
the recent movie on ?
you mean in movie theatres , you mean cinemas or-
if you are staying % uh near to orchard road there are % uh some movie theaters are which are available there .
% uh the one next to the hotel which i % uh say the budgeted hotel .
% uh plaza singapura has one of the movie theaters % uh inside there .
we call it the cineplex which has about eight theatres altogether .
so you can catch any % uh latest movie at that theater with very good sound system .
now , four d means that there 's a four- there are four different kind of effects you will get .
one of them is the spects that you could wear it have a three dimension effect , then % uh the last one is the lights and the bumpy % uh movement of the movie .
so that 's the other part and sound , the sound , the feeling of water if there 's a water coming out from- you will get some- you 'll get some sprinkle of water on your face-
yes .
so- so that 's the reason why we call it four d. if it 's three d then you get three d effects , three dimensional effect .
you 're welcome .
which one ?
desperado .
desperados are % uh % um % hm-
desperados % uh- % uh yah .
it 's the same thing like % um a four d movie but % uh-
yah .
desperados in fact is something like a horse riding shooting game .
it 's actually-
yah .
yah .
but % uh it 's a little bit different now because they have % um- they give you a three d glasses .
you can % uh actually use it for your shooting , % hm .
no , they shoot on the screen so you get % uh- to see who is the-
% uh who is the best shooters .
who 's a good sheriff .
yah .
no , they are not using real guns .
they are using % uh- electronic arcade 's guns .
yah .
% uh it 's not as easy as you think it will be .
% uh when you go to the arcades you usually shoot at the screen .
% uh this you actually sits on % um a wood- % uh what you call a wooden horse which will take you on a bumpy ride .
yah .
so how can- i help you further for the % uh your holidays there .
% uh the most famous attraction .
usually most of the tourist come they will not miss out sentosa .
that is one thing for sure .
yah .
the rides ?
in sentosa or you 're referring to some other parts of singapore ?
just in sentosa .
and you can probably can try- there 's one which is a little bit different .
% um we call it gogreen % uh segway .
it 's actually a cart ride % uh in sentosa , that is .
yah .
ecogood .
it 's actually a cart that they % uh the attraction will teach them how to use this cart .
% uh without walking you can actually walk over on the cart itself .
it 's also- % uh you have to learn how to balance it so that you can move the cart easily .
it 's what we call % uh cart .
this is one of them .
yah .
or if you want you can probably try this one .
not for lazy people it 's for attraction .
yah .
yah , that 's on the luge and sky ride .
so this one you probably can try if you like some rides .
they call it the luge .
these are the sky ride .
% uh not really .
if you want to see the whole singapore then you have to go to mount faber which is taking the cable car ride from there or you can also take the singapore flyer which you will be- so you 'll be able to catch the whole part of singapore .
this is one of- also a nice attraction in singapore which is also located in sentosa .
so if you want you can also join the diving % um- experience with our divers .
they will let you have a nice experience in the underwater world .
% uh yes , indeed .
we do have an interaction pool inside the underwater world where visitors can actually put their hands in % uh to touch the fish .
of course not to catch the fish , huh , but just to touch .
this is the one that you can see on the screen right now .
you can still put your hands in to touch the stingray , you can even feed the fish if you want .
the shark % um is also available .
you can % uh- we have to book in advance in order to have a dive with the shark .
yah , this is diving with the shark .
that is not a fish , that 's a shark .
other than dolphin , this is a seal .
seal , % uh .
% uh yah , that 's a dolphin .
you can also dive in there with the dolphin .
yes , it is .
% uh there 's a feeding session .
if you want- like to get involve you can also register with the underwater world .
a fish usually .
they eat a fish , yah .
dolphin eat fish .
which one ?
if you like a little bit adventure this one will be good .
the megazip adventure that takes you something like a sporting-
yah .
yah , it 's something like an obstacle .
we also- we have the flying fox which they will take the slide down all the way to the beach area .
yah , that 's the one which we call the flying fox .
% uh you 're welcome .
so i guess probably if you were to come for these two days your approximately expenses will be less than a thousand dollars .
probably around about % uh three to four hundred dollars if you are actually going for- not for fine dining if you have a budget that will probably cost you about five hundred dollars for the two of you .
thank you .
so % uh plan your holidays get in touch with us again so that we can help you .
you 're welcome .
you 're most welcome .
it 's my pleasure .
yes , my name is matthew .
so nice meeting you .

you 're most welcome .

% uh get in touch with us again .
% uh thank you .
hi good afternoon ,
my name is matthew here .
hi melanie my name is matthew and i am tour guide number three .
i 'm very good .
september the twentieth , % oh , right .
well every month is a good month .
september is having % uh a very nice event here in singapore .
at that particular month we have the formula one speed car racing .
do you like cars ?
% oh you 're not into that okay , alright .
so you 're not fond of car racing , cars .
then good for you because otherwise the ticket will be very- a little bit more costly .
% oh you have a daughter with you then .
so how old is she ?
she 's sixteen years old okay so she 's teenagers .
and how old are you ?
yah , may i ask ?
% oh you are thirty seven .
okay so you are coming with your daughter then .
s~
okay .
and do you have any budget in mind or take a places yah- or places that you may like to see in singapore ?
% uh yes that also depends on % uh which hotels you prefer to stay in a budget hotel or you prefer to stay a little bit much more premium hotel then you probably have less spending then .
alright .
but first thing before i go to the hotel can i just find out a little bit more from you ?
like for example if you are here in singapore you like to do shopping mall or you prefer to goes out to some theme park as well like theme park like you know % um some movie theme parks or some nature walk , visiting the garden all things like that or you prefer something else .
so that i can you know put you- put it in a place or hotel whereby near to that place , you spend less on transportation , % uh easy access to public transport so that- these are the things that i will have to help you to consider % uh and put you into the right place .
so tell me then .
alright .
you plan to go shopping a lot ?
okay .
and % uh any other thing in mind in that- other than the shopping ?
go outdoors .
theme parks or probably to nature ?
any will do ?
alright .
so if you are going for shopping then % um it has to be somewhere nearby and if you prefer to go to theme park then it has to be also located somewhere near % uh to the public transport as well .
so % uh do you mind % um i 'll like to show it to you one of the hotel which is quite budget and it 's located % um- wait huh .
wait let me see % uh .
well in singapore , here our weather - % uh the temperature wise % um maybe from twenty six degree to thirty six degree .
it 's pretty humid here .
so when you come to singapore try to wear some loose clothing do n't wear thick clothing it will be a lot more comfortable for you .
right .
% uh like i- no problem .
so let me just see whether i can pick up that hotel alright .
it 's actually known as hotel % um eighty one at rochor % uh which is actually a two-star hotel it 's a budgeted hotel .
and in- % uh from- you have a computer , right ?
now you- can you see from the screen itself where i 'm putting this % uh hotels up and-
no not the merlion .
right .
now if you were to take a look at the % uh- you 're seeing the hotel - you 're seeing the hotel rooms right now or no ?
yes % uh so you can see the hotel room , right ?
now if you were to see from the screen itself the room rate wise , i 'm trying to get the room rates for you so that you can probably budget your holiday here huh .
right , so for the room rate wise you can see it 's hundred and thirty five per room per night , right ?
so that will takes off % uh two hundred and seventy dollars from you .
so out of one thousand dollars two hundred and seventy dollars goes for that .
and for shopping street % um the hotel that you see here hotel eighty one is located quite near to the train system as well i 'll just show you the map where the location of the hotel is , yah ?
right .
you can see % uh from here the blue % um % uh bed which is here is actually hotel eighty one rochor .
it 's actually loated near to the station , two train system station which is there .
one is the little india station which we have the ne seven .
% uh from your hotel towards these % uh station is not very far away probably around about ten minutes of walking you should be able to reach that station ne seven which stand for north east bound train station number seven .
and the other one which is ew twelve that means that is a east west bound train station number twelve , it 's actually bugis station .
so if you are staying in this hotel - % uh if you are putting up in this hotel
% uh both of the access towards the public transport is quite convenient and not only that i~ you- it 's also located % uh near to little india .
that 's where a lot of indian products are been sold there specially ladies accessories you know and you are travelling with your daughter with you so probably you can find something % uh nice clothing of indian style .
% uh you can % uh pick it out along this little india where the serangoon road is located .
you can see this serangoon road .
% um i guess i just blow it up a little bit for you .
now , i guess you can see it right now right , serangoon road ?
the whole street which is along serangoon road is known as little india .
many of these shops located at this area sells a lot of indian % uh products from ladies wear to shoes , from accessories % uh anything you name it related to the indian community you have it there .
so this is one of the nice shopping street you can find near to your hotel .
the other one walking distance towards % uh the % uh rochor canal .
you can see that there is another one which i put it the screen up here
bugis street , can you see ?
right .
% uh bugis street is also quite near to your hotel walking distance is approximately about ten minutes away only .
and bugis junction , bugis tower and bugis village here is one of the other shopping street that you can find % uh near to your hotel .
% uh from the bugis street itself you can find varieties of % um clothing .
if you want cheap- a little bit- slightly much more cheap clothing % uh maybe in reasonable price % uh you can go to bugis village because those % uh area they sells a lot of % um t-shirts % uh ladies accessories % uh even for the guys if you need some watches you can pick it up from there .
there are some- a lot of watch % uh dealers which are selling watches over there as well .
and small little gift shops are also there .
if you need to make up % uh there is also % uh hair salon located at that area .
nice shopping street in fact .
so-
% uh it 's about ten minutes walk from your hotel .
if you see from the hotel the blue in colour ?
now you can see hotel eighty one rochor .
from there you can take a walk down and it 's not very far away , right ?
yes it 's quite safe % uh in singapore .
% um in fact nobody % uh should bothers you when you are walking along the street so long as you know you do n't % um i mean- % uh during the night time of course % uh we will suggest you not to outshine yourself by putting a lot of jewellery .
or % uh because % um % uh this people we- % uh in singapore here we are a very safe place but if you try to outshine too much and you 're walking along the street then that is not very healthy for you or safe for you , right ?
if you are wearing a decent clothing , you know walking around the street nobody will bother you .
in fact the policeman is out twenty four hours looking at every one of us .
yah , right .
so % um from here to any other shopping area is quite near .
even it 's % uh even it 's quite near to the hospital itself you can see there 's a raffles hospital nearby .
so in case anything % uh really needs- % uh in needs of the medical attention there is also available nearby to your hotel so not very far away .
food wise % uh for food there 's a lot of food courts available along your along the hotel that you are staying , along jalan besar .
and of course % uh albert street here you can see albert street , right ?
albert street , there is also another shopping mall very nearby .
% um there is one temple which is also a heritage temple that you should not miss in walking distance , % uh this temple here is known as the kwan im temple .
we call it goddess of mercy temple , very nice temple to visit .
of course if you want to ask for blessing this is also a nice temple to visit , yah .
so % uh shopping wise this is a nice area to be and of course % uh if this- this is the shopping part , right .
now the second thing you want is also for some theme park , right ?
a theme park for you daughter especially she 's sixteen years old she wanted to try something thrilling .
i will recommend you for % uh this sentosa .
sentosa and- inside sentosa we have a theme park here known as the resort world .
% uh resort world in sentosa is actually a theme park % um located inside sentosa itself .
yes correct .
yes it 's actually a universal studio located inside the sentosa .
and this universal studio if you are coming in the month of september , let me just help you up to see the ticket itself whether how much it 's gon na cost you and of course travelling from your hotel to universal studio .
% uh if you remember just now there is a train station called ew seve~ % oh sorry % um ne seven , that is from the little india .
it will actually takes you to the harbourfront % uh where the last stop is then you 'll have to change % uh this sentosa express to take you into the universal studio , right .
so that is a lot more easier not so much of % um walking to be done .
so click next on your screen right now you are seeing % uh it 's actually a calendar of universal studio .
now since you are coming in the month of september and it falls on the twentieth which is a thursday .
% uh if you go on a thursday the % um ticket will be a lot more cheaper if you go on the twentieth .
but if you go on the twenty first it will be a little bit more costly now because the friday is consider as a weekend rate .
so weekend rate means % uh peak rate so you 'll probably have to pay a fee more expensive .
so you can see % uh on the screen itself the non-peak is actually sixty eight dollars for adults and child is you have to fall in the range of between three years old to twelve years old .
so your daughter is sixteen years old i 'm sorry you do not- % uh you are not entitled for the children .
right .
so % uh she has to go on the adult fare .
so % uh i think i guess it would be around about a hundred and thirty six dollars .
so hundred and thirty six dollars together with your two sixty - % uh three plus , right .
so if % um you are going in onto this universal studio % uh we also do have an express pass which is available .
now this express pass of thirty dollars is add-on to your original ticket price of sixty eight dollars .
the express pass means that you- it actually allows you to access to a shorter queue inside the attraction .
because you know universal studio is a very % uh new attraction in singapore so many other visitors will queue up for their rides and by queuing it actually waste a lot of time so a lot of them may wanted to purchase the express pass to get away from the queue .
so thirty dollars additional if you really want to jump the queue , yah .
but of course if not then you can have a full day there which is the universal studio op~ % uh the operating hour is between % uh nine forty five in the morning and it will end in the evening at seven .
so seven p.m . will be % uh- yes .
now from your hotel - yah , there are hotel transportation that you see on the screen is again you can see a ne seven .
now-
% uh in total of walking and % uh waiting for the train it will approximately about half an hour .
at the most .
yes at the most , yah .
well if you are walking towards ne seven the transportation from ne seven to the vivocity where this % uh sentosa % uh express is is going to cost you at the most is about three dollars per person so you pay about six dollars .
yah .
then from there if you- % uh from there you take % um the sentosa express which is also another kind of train that allows you for admission into sentosa and then you pay three dollars more so total six .
so in all in all you pay around about twelve dollar .
six yah twelve dollar .
yah .
if you are taking the train it will ends you up in vivocity which is the last stop of the train system .
and from there you have to take another train which lead you into sentosa island .
this train is only accessible from the vivocity itself .
so the connecting train is in the shopping mall of the vivocity .
so if you take the train from the sentosa express it 's only costing you three dollars .
yah .
yah .
so from there in fact % uh if you finish your vis~ % uh what you call universal studio you can also take back the same train to vivocity again where you can do your shopping again .
because vivocity is also a very nice shopping mall to shop % uh which i do n't think you will miss- i 'll just give you % uh an idea of this vivocity here , alright .
now vivocity is up here as you can see % um this is the screen of the vivocity .
nice place to be , nice shopping mall .
yah .
the shopping mall actually starts at ten and it will end in the evening at ten .
yah .
so you can see getting there , there are a few ways of getting .
% uh you can see % uh the screen which is right now having by mrt , can you see mrt ?
yah .
so take the north east line and alight at harbourfront .
so the station that near to your hotel is called the north east line .
so you will stop at this area here called the harbourfront centre .
so only from here you take the sentosa express to the sentosa island .
so it 's quite near the minute when you come back again after you did universal studio you can also drop in in this shopping mall and do your shopping before going back to your hotel .
% uh well the mrt actually operates from morning % uh it ends in the evening the last train leaving is at twelve midnight .
yah .
right .
% uh other places to go to .
right the % um- the % uh the universal studio is what you want to know more right ?
or you prefer something else ?
okay .
% uh if you 're going for universal studio , if you are buying the express pass you probably can end up in sentosa island again which is near- next to the universal studio .
% uh you can also enjoy a beach % uh show which is very popular in singapore right now we call it song of the sea .
song of the sea is actually located in sentosa and i just % uh put up this for you in sentosa , yah .
so in sentosa you can see % um on your screen right now .
okay , see the sentosa ?
alright .
so sentosa is another % uh park whereby % uh you can catch the song of the sea in the evening .
it 's a very wonderful show .
it 's actually a laser show % um with fireworks and waterworks .
i just give you small outlook of the song of the sea % uh for you huh .
just give me % uh coming .
that you should not missed because % uh the show song of the sea show , there 's a limit to the show .
% um about two thousand five hundred visitors are able to get the seat for a single show .
so for that show- there are two shows happening in the day % uh in the evening in fact % uh seven forty and eight forty .
additional shows only happens during the weekends , saturday .
so you can see % um the normal ticket is at ten dollars so % uh you can catch this , that particular show before you end your trip % uh in % uh the sentosa .
so that will fully occupy your full day in fact .
yes .
you see % uh from my screen here there 's a lot of attraction which are here .
% uh we have the attraction at imbiah lookout .
% uh we have attractions at siloso point along the beach area and resort world .
so you can see the resort world is the wonder i 'm talking about of universal studio , right ?
yah .
it 's actually on the right hand side of your screen you can see universal studio .
so sentos~ universal studio is located inside sentosa itself .
so other than going elsewhere for % um- to take your transport by wasting a lot of time to get to the destination why do n't you % uh do the what you call the universal studio and at the same time finish up sentosa then .
because sentosa is also a nice place to go .
% uh yah .
if you have plenty of time then if you are buying the express pass probably you can also visit the underwater world which is located inside sentosa .
but this sentosa underwater world only % um opens from the % uh nine a.m . to nine p.m . so you have to catch that timing .
it 's actually a nice place to be .
but if you want your daughter to enjoy a little bit more probably you can % uh put this sentosa in during the day time and enjoy diving with the shark package in sentosa underwater .
and that will be nice .
if you are not going for the universal studio i should say yes it 's enough .
% uh if you 're going for universal studio then i 'm sorry .
sentosa one day together with resort world not possible .
yah if you see- % uh if you 're not going to dive with the shark then i have guess % uh it should be enough for % uh less than a thousand dollars , yes .
what 's the good time for shopping ?
% uh well-
you see as i say % uh there are so many shopping centres around .
% uh the place whereby you are putting up is also a nice place for shopping .
in fact you can get lots and lots of % um clothing accessories for you and your daughter .
and even if you want to become an indian for one day you can go to little india and % uh have something on your hand put on the hand need to be drawn on your hand and see how it looks like to become an indian .
% uh they are not only from india but because the design are mainly catered to the indian taste .
like for example if you- % uh the indian have a little bit more on the design of the god of % uh the indian .
sometimes they also have a necklace which been designed with % uh the indian cursive % uh floweries .
so those are the design to the indian taste not actually made from india but some indian may have make it in europe .
they bring it back to singapore to sell it % uh to % uh at that place .
so there are retailer shops actually open at that area mainly catered to the indian needs not from india .
% uh yes indeed , there are lot of restaurant which are there you can see down here in sentosa .
if you want to enjoy the dining at the beach area we also have you can dine indoors and outdoors .
anything you name it you can have it .
% uh if you are talking about dinning in the restaurant then of course % uh it will be a little bit different compare to the street food or we call it % uh the local food - i mean the hawker centres and the food court , yah .
because it 's air-conditioner and it 's a very good environment also , is n't it ?
so you feel good-
% uh yes of course .
even if you would like to try some of our local dishes like the hainanese chicken rice they also available % uh at the hawker centre .
so if you are staying nearby to this little india % uh there 's lot of mall which have air-conditioner food court .
you can try all those % uh local dishes at that area .
sometime if you really do n't find you probably- % uh and also very skeptical having the local dishes , yah there 's also a lot of western food available as well .
yah .
yes .
the boat ?
% hm % oh i- are you looking at the same page i 'm looking at ?
the sentosa ?
% uh dine and shop , yah .
boats .
yah that 's why yah i do n't see any boats here % uh yah .
% uh ya~ yah there - yah you are telling me boats so okay no . no i do n't see any boats here .
there is some other ways you can take by the mean of public transport .
you can have taxi are also available , % uh buses are also available .
% um those are the few option you can take , yah .
by bus is approximately % um also amount about the same about % uh thirty to forty five minutes , yah .
% uh almost similar like the train .
yes ?
i will say train because- because bus you need to stop every traffic light the train got no traffic light so he 's just cutting across .
% oh i see .
the thing is % uh if you 're walking towards that station then it takes some time right ?
if you are waiting for a bus you just walk towards the bus stop that which is not very far from your hotel then you take pick up the bus and go .
but it 's going to be take about thirty to forty five minutes , alright ?
but if you are taking the train then is a lot more comfortable because % uh by walking towards train % uh station there is the walking distance only .
then from the train there is no waiting time for the traffic condition .
if you are taking the buses then of course if there is a heavy traffic then you get congested the time may drag even longer .
yah .
correct .
% uh inclu- i 'm sorry that is a budget hotel so no breakfast is included .
but % uh the hotel which you are staying % uh near to that particular area if you see on the screen now
you will find that along the street here there is a lot food court or we call it coffee shops available .
coffee shops are % uh they sell coffee in the morning % uh they sell toasted bread with eggs , half boiled egg or full boiled egg .
sometime you can also get noodles and also if you like to try our indian style of breakfast we call it roti prata which is made up of flour .
they fry it on the pan and it 's quite tasty with- if you dip it into a curry sauce .
yah .
you can try this % um near to your hotel and it 's quite cheap also .
for breakfast probably you pay around about % uh three dollars you can get a good and nice breakfast , yah .
% uh well it- almost everywhere is the same .
whether you change it in your place or you can change it in singapore it 's still would be the same rate .
yes , anywhere will do .
you need not- yah you need not to be in singapore .
correct .
the place that you are staying % uh at little india there 's a lot of money changer as well so you need not have to worry .
even if you are not changing that money right now you can get the money changer at any other shopping mall .
there 's a lot of money changer at the shopping mall so you need not to worry about your currency it 's quite easy and convenient .
well there is a website that you can estimate the exchange rate but % um you can not use that rate as the fix rate .
yes change everyday .
yah so you have to check it everyday .
yah .
yah .
% uh well there is % uh- no , there is no places that you should not go to but % um of course % uh dark areas behind the shop houses you should not try to venture .
the dark places behind the shop houses is actually not good .
but walking along the main street doing the shopping % uh it 's fine , it 's quite safe here in singapore .
yah .
yah .
you did n't have to worry because along the way you can have burger kings , kfc which is kentucky fried chicken , mcdonalds is everywhere fast food is available .
even if you are staying in your hotel if you 're hungry intend not to get out from your hotel you can also call % uh mcdonald , they will deliver to your hotel .
so- correct , that is very convenient .
% uh need not to worry you will not die on hunger .
well % uh ya~ yah i guess % uh you have heard a lot things that what you should ask , what you should do , what you should not do but % uh one thing just bear this in mind treat singapore as your home % uh that will be good enough .
because if you treat singapore as your home deffinitely there is no other places that you should- what you should do and why you should not do .
because % uh if you treat singapore as your home you definitely do n't throw litters in your home , right ?
you do n't throw papers at your home right ?
you do n't spill all over the places at your home , right ?
so you treat singapore as your home then nobody will fine you then there 's nothing that you can not do .
but as far as if you i am- i guess you are not a smoker , right ?
yah .
then that 's fine because smoking in singapore there is- it 's not a ban but % uh certain places are prohibited from smoking .
so sometime when your friends tell you- say that there are certain things that you should not do in singapore where one of them is smoking .
no smoking is allowed but not in public places places like places at bus stop you are not allowed to smoke , places in shopping mall you are not allowed to smoke .
the reason is because they want to make sure that you know % um you have to protect the interest of the public .
if you are smoking the smokers will not % uh have as bad % um % uh influence compare to the one who is not smoking , right ?
because their second hand smoke will cause more damage to the non-smoker .
so that was the reason why we have restrict them from smoking in the public area .
yes there is .
% uh so long it 's at the open air and it 's not in- and it 's away from the crowded area it 's fine .
and now you are asking about the exchange rate it 's on your screen right now .
you can see this is how the exchange rate goes right now .
yah .
so you- twenty cents .
twenty nine cents .
% uh yes .
they are very friendly , they are able to- most of them are able to speak english .
so if you use english as % um the communication language there should n't be a any problem even from getting from one place to another most of the places are written in english it is quite easy to understand .
yah .
no definitely not .
if % uh you do have give me call i will definitely help you up .
yes we do have a safari here in singapore the most popular one is we call it the night safari .
the night safari in fact is something like a night zoo and it 's coming up on your screen right now .
this % uh night zoo in fact showcase you about the % um night animals .
and during the night time most of us are in bed sleeping we did n't know what is going outside in the nature .
what sort of animal are very active during the night time compare to day time like the chimpanzee are quite active during the day time , right ?
so you can see a lot of chimpanzee are very active but during the night time most of the chimpanzee are sleeping just like us .
well there are some public buses which will take you there .
if you are staying near to that particular place you can go there yourself by public transport or you can also pick up their express buses there .
you can see % uh getting there which i 'm gon na click right now .
and you can see these are some the pickup points % uh from the city area .
from the city area means from the nearby area .
so since you are staying at little india the nearest place to pick up will be at hotel rendezvous .
hotel rendezvous .
so % uh you can just take a walk from your hotel to hotel rendezvous it 's about another % uh ten minutes you should be at the hotel rendezvous .
or otherwise you can also pick up the % uh train system % uh from there .
% uh you can see if from here % uh , right .
the mrt station , you can take the mrt towards that area or you can even take the buses from here .
you can see that the bus service number % um nine two six and nine two seven , nine two six and one seven one .
it is located quite near to your hotel .
so you can pick up those buses and go to night safari also .
correct .
it 's thirty to forty minutes because the bus need to travel from your area which is the % uh the centre of the singapore all the way towards the north area it 's approximately around about that time , yes .
n~ % um . no . in fact the buses are available until twelve midnight the train system also available until twelve midnight .
so if you want to- if you would not be able to catch those two you can also catch a taxi which is also available the last mean of transportation to go back , yah .
and to get a taxi -
do n't worry , mostly the taxi fare if it 's you are taking taxi probably it will cost you around about % uh thirty five dollars .
right .
yah .
but otherwise you can just leave a little bit early just % uh before eleven you can leave .
but usually if you go to night safari we usually goes around about five thirty or five p.m . because night safari is open at seven but % uh when the drive bus journey takes you there it will be just nice for you to get around to take some nice photograph before the night safari opens up the gates % uh for you to view .
yah .
so by the time you finish % um your attraction inside night safari it should be around about ten .
% um it should be fine for you to get % uh to your hotel without any problem .
okay that % uh really depends on you .
for a normal person you will finish around about three to- % uh three and a half hours you should be able to get done with it .
yah .
correct .
well if you like nature singapore botanical garden will be a nice place to visit .
it 's actually free of charge .
and from your places to the % um- now i got from your places to that % uh singapore botanical garden
there is also a train system available .
so if you were to see from the map here on the screen itself you 'll find little india at that particular station over there .
so if you take the train system down % uh all the way towards- yah the- % uh sorry .
if you take the train system you can also lead towards botanical garden .
it 's quite easy and convenient .
so yah you can take it down all the way towards the % uh dhoby ghaut station change the train up there or you can take the yellow % um the bras basah line all the way one round towards the botanical garden .
so the train fare approximately i sup~ going to be around about two dollars per person .
so botanical garden will be a nice place to visit as well .
yes botanical garden is free .
and of course % uh let me just pull up botanical garden for you , alright .
% uh right .
% uh merlion is actually an icon of singapore .
it was only created in nineteen seventy two- the park is created in nineteen seventy two .
the lion head symbolised the % uh founding of the island and of course the fish body just symbolised the humble fishing village .
so % uh that was the reason why we put it together and called it merlion .
right .
% ah yes , indeed .
we use that to symbolise singapore .
yah there you are , that 's the singapore botanical garden and this is- yah .
this is % uh how to get there .
you can either go by three ways , the mrt which is the circle line which i have told you about just now .
you can see the yellow line -
yah .
and you also can get % um down by foot from your hotel % uh to take a walk there it is not convenient but you can take a bus directly from your hotel .
there are- these buses here you can see via bukit timah ,
that will be the buses available for you to pick up to the singapore botanical garden .
and it opens during the morning five a.m . all the way to twelve midnight .
but % uh if you are visiting singapore botanical garden you should not miss the national orchid garden .
it 's a very nice garden % uh with lots of beautiful flowers .
i guess your daughter and you will be enjoying the photography session inside the national orchid garden .
so there is a fees for you to pay in order to get admission , again it 's five dollars per adults and children have to be below twelve .
yah .
correct .
if you are going into the national orchid garden .
if you are not then the admission for the botanical garden is free of charge .
yes of course .
that 's the reason for visiting attraction , right ?
% uh you can take-
there are only- there- yah there are some places like the night safari .
the night safari % uh photography is allowed but flash photography is not allowed .
% uh because during the night time some flash light from the cameras may harm the animal so it may cause the animal to run into danger .
so that is the reason why flash photograph are not allowed inside the night safari .
yah .
% uh it will approximately about half an hour to forty five minutes , yah .
i will suggest you to take the train it 's a lot more easier .
yah thirty to forty five minutes .
because the minute when you % uh get out from the airport the train system from the airport is to this station called tanah merah interchange whereby you have to walk across the other platform to pick up the other train towards to your hotel .
so-
not it 's % uh- from the airport there is a direct train from the airport to the tanah merah interchange which is % um about five minutes of % uh mrt ride , yah .
no .
not it 's la~ and not difficult to locate .
from the airport to the hotel it 's approximately about two to three dollars because you need to deposit one dollar additional for the ticket .
it will be refunded to you immediately after you get exit from the train station and get a refund from the machine by slotting in the ticket back into the ticket machine .
it will give you the refund of the deposit of the ticket itself .
yah inclusive of this waiting time or waiting for the % uh train to come waiting for while you 're walking .
so that is % uh taking into consideration .
no it 's quite easy to read our maps .
if you see the map here which is on the screen right now .
you 'll find that the little india is there that 's where your hotel is right ?
do you remember ?
yah right .
so from little india if you were to see it 's quite near to bugis and bugis is the one- that is the one that you see on your map it will leads you all the way to changi airport .
can you see changi airport ?
on the right hand side which has a number three there .
so changi airport has % um a train system which will lead to tanah merah you can see tanah merah there and that is an interchange that you have to change a train just by walking across the platform .
it will takes you all the way down % uh towards the % uh what you call , % uh the bugis area where you can walk towards your hotel .
your hotel is in between little india and bugis .
so it 's quite near , you do n't have to worry .
yah .
yes % uh changi airport .
we- yes , this is the international airport .
we do have three airport but this is the only airport which % uh have % uh flights coming in from- % uh passenger flights coming in .
the other airports are mainly for military use and also meant for private jets and not for big % uh passenger aircraft .
yah .
yes i will suggest you to get it done % uh from the internet itself because % um only when confirmation are there then they will give you the room .
% uh no definitely not .
you- there 's a lot of % uh food court , coffeshops are available , restaurants are also available so % uh do n't worry .
food everywhere .
yes .
yes , correct .
well you only have two days so i have given you the choice i have given you four choice to choose .
right ?
you are most welcome .
it 's my pleasure .
thank you .
i hope to see you soon .
and should if you have any more query you can % uh- feel free just to drop by me again % uh i 'm happy to share it with you again , yah .
bye .
same to you .
bye .
hi , good morning .
my name is mathew .
my name is mathew , i 'm the tour guide three % uh speaking to you right now .
how can i help you today ? and-
how can i help you today ? and-
alright .
% uh firstly , can i know when will you be travelling to singapore ?
saturday and sundays ?
and do you have any budget in mind that you like me to assist you accordingly to the budget you % uh propose ?
alright .
% uh first thing % um you need % uh- do you need a hotel to say in singapore , right ?
or you have your planning of your own hotel ?
alright .
okay , usually % uh you plan to travel by- the means of public transport ; like the train and the buses ?
or you prefer to travel in a little comfort with taxi ?
alright , in singapore most of the taxis are run by metre .
% uh the maximum it will go from one place to one end of singapore to the other end , will cost you around about forty singapore dollars to forty five dollars .
% um usually in singapore , we only use singapore currency .
so if you were to use us currency , you probably have to multiply by one point two .
correct .
then we go by the mean of public transport , which is the train system and the bus system will be good .
yah .
right .
no problem , i 'll assist you out .
and i 'll teach you how to go around .
and % uh before i proceed , i need to find a few things from you .
one is , % uh what do you have in mind % uh when you % uh come to singapore ?
you like to visit some of the attraction or theme park , or you prefer to see some nature , or you prefer to do a little bit of shopping on electronics or you buy something to give back home for your families ?
in fact , there , i will have to consider % eh your needs , so that i can place you at the right hotel where you will save up on transportation cost , and also % um for food wise , where can you pick it up % uh as well .
so , that was the reason why i 'm asking this question right now .
right .
now % um for you budget if you are going for a thousand dollars % uh in singapore , i 'm very sure that you will not be able to get % uh a good beach resort .
% uh and transportation wise from the beach to any of the attraction which you would like to visit , is not advisable , because % uh the transportation wise is not very convenient from the beach area .
so probably you will have to look at % um maybe taking somewhere in the city area , where the train systems are available and they will be probably helpful for you to move around in singapore % uh at % uh a budget cost .
yah .
okay .
right .
% uh right now i 'm actually % um i guess you are having a screen share with me right now , right ?
alright , now can you-
alright .
first thing % uh i would like to just put it up to you that % uh there is a hotel which i 'm looking at right now , which is called hotel eighty one bencoolen .
and this is actually a budget hotel .
% uh they have no breakfast in this particular hotel .
but % um next to the surrounding of the hotel , there is a lot of , we call it food court or coffee shops , are there .
so that means that in the early morning , instead of getting your breakfast in the hotel , % uh which is % hm % uh which they do n't serve % uh breakfast , you can pick it up at the next door where the coffee shop is .
we call it coffee shop is basically because in the early morning and throughout the day , they do serve coffee , tea , and , you know , cakes , % uh toasted breads .
those things you can get it there at a very cheap rate .
% uh some of the coffee shops do open twenty four hours .
some of them they only operate from the morning as early as six in the morning .
and then they probably finish their business in the evening at around about nine to ten , yah .
so- % eh renting a room is % um we do n't have those kind of % uh- we do have those backpackers ' room , but it 's not advisable to have a visitor first time .
you try on the backpackers ' room .
probably you get-
backpackers .
we call it a backpackers .
yah , correct .
probably a hotel like this % uh hotel eighty one at bencoolen , that would be good for you .
you can see that the room rate wise is about hundred and ten dollars per night .
and it is not really very costly .
if you are staying for two-night , you probably pay around about two hundred and twenty dollars at the most .
so and- yah .
yah just the stay .
you can see this is the hotel .
you can see it from your screen right now this is how the hotel looks like .
alright , the bed is slightly a little more comfortable .
right , and-
yah .
yah .
no , in fact is hundred and ten is quite cheap % uh if it 's located at the city area .
and moreover , you can see from yourself from the screen right now , i 'm loading it up for you .
and if you see % uh carefully on the map itself ,
it is quite accessible % um to the public transport .
yes , located in the city area where % uh most of the public transports are available .
okay , you can see from the map right now , % um the blue % uh icon which is here ,
% uh it 's hotel eighty one bencoolen .
it 's a two-star hotel .
if you 're going for three-star , then it will be a lot more costly .
so that 's why you 're going for a budget hotel .
yes , you can see down there it 's written down there , this is a budget hotel , right ?
compare to the % uh normal hotel you 're looking at .
so and it 's not only that , it 's close by to the train system .
there are three kind of train system which is available there , you know , within the walking distance .
so dhoby ghaut is the station which have three trains linking together .
the cc one and ne six , ns twenty four .
% uh these are the kind of trains connecting train .
that means at these area , it 's an interchange of trains .
so if you were to travel going to % uh northeast , you have the northeast line there .
if you are going to % uh north-south , then you have the north-south train station .
you also have the cc one which is circle line train system .
so it 's all nearby and not only that you can also % uh take a walk towards the ew twelve which is on your map .
this is the east-west bound train .
it 's very simple to identify .
% uh ew means east-west .
twelve means station number twelve .
so this is % uh how nearby it is % uh to your hotel , walking distance .
so probably from east station % uh from the station , dhoby ghaut station , to your hotel , probably about % hm ten minutes ' walk .
and then maybe from your hotel to the east-west bound train , another fifteen minutes walk and that 's it .
right .
% uh no , this is a budget hotel .
so definitely you would not be having % uh those kind of facilities % uh like the swimming pools and all those staff .
because if you are looking at swimming , then you have to have a full-fledged hotel or something like a three-star or four-star hotel .
then you 'll have all those facilities .
right .
% eh in fact this hotel do not serve % uh food .
they only % uh rooms available only .
you can see it from here , these are the hotel facilities here .
% uh there are bars and pubs which are there .
but % uh-
yah .
you see % uh in singapore here it 's quite convenient .
if you are quite hungry and you do n't wan na get out from the hotel room , you just need to do is to dial % uh for their food like mcdonalds % uh kentucky fried chicken , % um , you know , pizza huts .
and those are available through a phone call away , yah .
so when the , % uh well there is a delivery charges for some of the % uh fast food .
like mcdonalds , they do charge % uh a service charge of two dollars .
yah , additional two dollars on top of your % uh food order .
so it 's % uh quite reasonable .
it should be okay .
you can see that % uh the rooms are all so internet access , there are safe deposit box which are there .
wi-fi in public area , shops are there , % uh laundry self-service are there , elevators are there .
so the only thing is , it 's a budget hotel , so it does not have swimming pools and restaurants
% uh wi-fi is available in your room , but % uh you can see down here it says internet access wireless complimentary .
that means that it 's free inside your room .
yah .
yah .
no , laundry service is not that for free .
% eh you have to put- laundry service are chargeable .
% uh maybe it goes by % uh per unit basis .
maybe will cost you around about four dollars for washing and drying .
yah .
safety deposit box usually is % uh free of charge .
usually it 's free of charge .
because % uh you can put the safe deposit inside your room .
% uh there is a small little safe deposit inside your room
yah .
okay .
% uh yes , we do have the other % uh hotel which is also % uh hotel eighty one % uh put up a little bit where the % uh rochor canal road is .
there is also another hotel called hotel eighty one .
% uh let me just bring you back here .
% oh i think , wait huh .
yah .
okay .
a couple 's room ?
alright .
it 's a couple 's room .
it 's a twin bed there or you can also request for a king size bed or queen size bed .
yah run this thing up .
yah .
yah .
% uh singapore weather % uh the temperature is ranged between twenty six degree to thirty five degree .
% uh usually highest you can get % uh thirty six , but we do reach thirty six sometime .
yah , it 's quite humid here .
right .
% um i do n't think there-
yes the hotel rooms are air conditioner .
so you need not have to worry about
no , of course not .
okay , here we are , we have another hotel here which is a three-star hotel known as the fragrance hotel .
and let 's see whether do it % uh-
right .
yes , it 's quite near to hotel eighty one so the room rate is about hundred dollars per night .
so it 's about ten dollars lesser only at the most .
it is also quite near , yah .
yah .
so you can see it 's located- yah .
alright , you can see that % uh fragrance hotel is a little bit outskirt % uh from the city , it 's quite near to the edge of the city .
then , i would say % uh going out away from the city .
yah it 's located some , yah .
that is the reason why % uh it 's % uh slightly cheaper compared to the hotel that i 'm talking about just now .
and you can see there the distance from this hotel % uh to the train station where i show you about the dhoby ghuat , it 's a little bit further away , is n't it ?
or do n't you think so ?
you- either you can take the other station which is quite nearby , which is only the train system called it ne seven .
the ne seven is a northeast bound train .
station number seven , it 's a little india station .
you can take the train system from here .
% uh it will lead you back to that station which is called the % uh dhoby ghaut station .
the only difference is that this is near to only two station , that is near to three station .
% uh i would say four station .
that means there are connecting trains % uh available just at the site .
so , even you were to go to the north , you can get train easily , even you wan na go down to % um at the west , there 's also some connecting train which is available .
so it 's like , you know , it 's quite convenient compared the % um % uh this hotel that you are staying .
% eh there is only two trains that you can pick it up .
one is a northeast line , the other one is the east-west bound train % uh line and that 's it .
so same thing % uh northeast line will takes you about five minutes ' walk towards that station .
and ew will takes you another about ten minutes ' walk to that particular station .
yah .
so you , huh ?
sorry , i can not get- yah .
what are the facilities there ?
okay .
okay , you can see that this do come with % uh- this do come with a small little pool , yes .
there 's small little pool , restaurants are there .
yah .
and if you are coming with your girlfriends then % uh superior room will be good for you .
sorry ?
what do you get your first- your one hundred dollar stay complimentary ?
coffee will be serve to you % um i guess breakfast .
i- maybe i let you see whether there 's breakfast for you .
i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast .
% uh we 'll wait and see .
% uh no i do n't think there is breakfast here .
% uh no . they do have breakfast .
they do have breakfast if you are taking the executive deluxe room .
the superior rooms are not with breakfast , yah .
yah .
no . hundred dollars , yah .
correct .
yes , it 's for the lodging .
so you can % uh coffee , tea % uh some sandwiches are there .
% uh that 's it .
and not like this .
that is usually the- in the hotel wise , the restaurants are there .
% uh usually they serve the local % uh we say the % uh ancient asia % uh deli~ % uh food that is % uh in southeast asia , yah .
yah .
they- outside , yah .
outside your hotel % uh there is a chinese restaurant % uh across the road .
then if you love indian food , indian curry , that you have to walk across to that train station that i 'm talking about .
the whole street there call serangoon road , in fact is % um a place whereby % eh % uh most of the indian food are sold there .
% uh you can of course take a walk there if you want to .
you can see on this part of the area , you 'll find that % um serangoon road .
can you see that serangoon road ?
no , do you- can you see the ne seven ?
yah , ye- the ne seven in the serangoon road % uh which is here .
yah , this is the whole street whereby a lots of indian food are sold here .
lots of % um indian related accessories and also % uh indian goods which you % uh will like to take a look at or to purchase them .
and this is a very good street for % uh tourist as well .
% uh yah .
yah .
so instead of going very far away , staying in a nice hotel in the city , if you stay nearby here , quite near to the station , and also near to little india where you can shop around to found out more about the indian community while living here .
and , not only that % uh goods which are related to the indian community , may have not come from indian itself , it may % uh came from europe .
people who are staying in europe , but they are indians .
they pre~ % uh they made those things and then they bring back to singapore and sell it here .
yah .
okay .
so- okay , so hotel wise , i guess this would be your choice , right ?
% um from here then we will go to your attraction , right ?
% uh right .
so i guess % uh you had heard about % uh % uh you said- just now you were saying that you love % uh theme parks , right ?
% uh so % uh the next one that i 'm gon na tell you is about a theme park which is % uh also accessible % uh by train to this theme park .
so this theme park , the name of the theme park in fact is called the universal studio .
yes .
we have universal studio here in singapore .
so % um just give me a minute and let 's pull out the universal studio for you , huh ?
% eh no , usually- it will not be a package deal , because you see the thing is you have a limited of time in singapore , you only have two days .
and with these two days , you try to see % uh what is % uh most interesting here .
then to hop a few places whereby you kinda physically enjoy it .
so-
% uh yah .
yah , i see- % uh i do n't think you will like to go to a place whereby , you know % uh when you reach there , okay % uh five minutes we have to go .
that goes to another place .
then you know it 's like you do n't visit the place at all .
you just go there and % uh see the entrance and then they leave .
i- alright .
so , basically make full use of your time when you are here in singapore .
if you % uh in the later part if you have more budget and you wanted to stay for a longer time , then that you can probably consider at the later part .
alright .
so probably if want to catch the latest in singapore , the universal studio is one of the place that you should not miss % uh if you like theme park .
so here we are then you can see this is universal studio .
and we have the transformer here , the transformer ride .
and transformer ride in fact is % uh quite new .
and % uh this % uh transformer has been showing in % uh new york .
% uh but of course % uh singapore is having one of the best of all .
so i 'm gon na show you right now % um how to get there , what are the ticket price which is involve , yah .
right .
now , how to get there % uh to universal studio , in fact from your hotel , if you were to take % um the northeast train , which we call it the ne seven from your hotel you remember , right ?
the ne seven .
now , the ne seven will take you all the way up to % uh the station here call the harbourfront .
harbourfront .
okay , if you were to see below % uh down here , you can see northeast line , mrt rail , okay ?
now the northeast line mrt rail- okay , if you look carefully you will find that this is % uh little india , right .
can you see from the screen ?
okay .
so from you screen yeh , the ne seven is the nearest train that you can pick it up .
so it 's lit~ % eh the station in fact is known as little india .
you take the train all the way from little india to the harbourfront which is here .
the number six , right .
so that will be the ending part of the northeast line .
and from the northeast line , the same building itself , there is a sentosa express which is there .
but the distance from your little india to harbourfront , approximately fare for the train ride per person is about three dollars .
yah , three dollars .
then- approximately about ten minutes from here , huh .
so from this % uh station when you get out from this station , in fact it 's also known as harbourfront .
but the building name is known as vivocity .
vivocity .
% uh v i v o .
yes .
yah , from the vivo station , there is a sentosa express which % eh will lead you into universal studio .
yes , there is an express train , we call it the sentosa express .
if you will take a look here , on your map- on your screen again , you can see sentosa express .
can you see the screen right now ?
still clicking .
yah , alright .
so from your screen , you can see sentosa express which is located in vivocity level three .
you can pick up the sentosa express to this station called waterfront station .
this sentosa express only goes into sentosa island and with % uh universal studio is located inside this sentosa island .
and it 's run by the organisation called the resort world singapore .
so resort world is also part of sentosa , so you have to take that train to the % uh universal studio and the station to alight is one station away only which is known as the waterfront station , alright ?
but for this admission , you will have to pay an admission fees of three dollars .
three dollars for the admission .
if you wan na save up some money , again % uh you can always do a morning exercise by taking a walk into the sentosa island which you have to pay an admission of one dollar .
yah , so there are-
% eh yes , of course .
% uh you wil~ % uh are you with me on the screen right now ?
can you see the sentosa express there ?
now if you- it states down there take sentosa express % uh to % uh located on level three vivocity lobby l and alight at waterfront and the flag fee of three dollars apply .
so that means that you have to % uh % um pay the admission fee % uh at the % uh train % uh at the sentosa counter .
so they will get- correct .
no , they- yah , approximately , yes correct .
yah .
yes .
correct .
yes .
yes , correct .
yes , yap , in total it 's about , yah .
yah .
yes , correct .
yah .
so % uh that is possible if you choose either one of them , you see .
if you wan na take it % uh take a ride in the comfort manner , if you 're walking all the way to get sweat in the early morning , % uh you wan na take a ride quickly to the universal studio , you just pay the three dollars for the admission at this sentosa express .
then , of course that is a lot more convenient .
well , of course % uh if you choose too , % um % uh , okay .
if you choose % um to take the pub~ direct public buses % uh only applies for foreigners , % uh you can pick it up at bencoolen street or bencoolen 's road which is quite near to your hotel .
but you have to go to the correct hotel .
so % um you can see % uh on your map right now % uh under universal studio , free shuttle service .
that provided if you are staying % uh nearby to that particular area .
yah .
let me see from here .
% um that 's by seeing the opportunity , huh ?
okay , now % um from the bus schedule itself , it is seems like you can only pick up % uh this shuttle service , at summer view hotel which is not far walking distant from your hotel .
but there is a timing for you to catch if you want to % uh have a pick up from there .
yes , it go directly to the theme park .
okay , let me see % ah . alright the universal studio % uh buses , is actually free of charge .
yah , but you have to walk to that particular hotel .
it 's approximately about ten minutes .
if you were to see just now at the fragrance hotel , and i show you the map again .
okay , now can you take a look at your map right ?
you 'll find that the blue % uh ho~ the blue icon which is there is your hotel .
and summer view hotel is located at this end .
here , on this side .
you have to walk cutting across % um the street itself .
then you will reach the summer view hotel and you have to pick up that the sentosa % uh shuttle service which is free of charge from there to universal studio .
alright .
so is walking distance still but % uh the option is yours .
% uh if you want to pick up the free shuttle service .
now , coming back , % um this is the main or way of transportation to that particular place , right .
and of course % uh next thing is you 'd like to know how much is the ticket for the universal studio , right ?
no , that- no , that is the transportation part that you need to pay for your transportation .
yes , the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island .
it does n't apply to the admission to the attraction called universal studio .
yes , correct .
so , going to % uh-
correct .
so- correct .
yah .
so right now % um i 'm trying to % uh put up the % uh- i trying to pull up the season chart .
and you can see % uh in a while on your screen % uh there is a universal studio calendar .
the minute when you see the calendar , just % uh let me know .
so that i can go through with you on the calendar , to let you see and how the price are actually work out for the universal studio .
well , it 's % uh-
okay , now , % uh you are with the universal studio calendar right now ?
alright , now you can see that the-
yah , on the april seventh - now , % uh on the seventh if you are trying to go for universal studio , % uh you will really have to go pretty way in advance .
that means is probably you have to try your luck now in order to make sure that you can get the ticket online .
now , % uh the ticket price , if you are really going on the seventh , which i would advise not to , but you choose to go on the seventh , then you have to prepare .
% uh there will be a huge crowd in the universal studio .
and if you are going on the eighth , then that will be slightly better .
but then you still face the crowd .
% uh but of course there is % uh the secondary way out for this , % uh for the peak season , we call it the peak because it 's during the weekend .
the adult fee is seventy four dollars , and of course % uh you are not senior citizen , right ?
okay , right .
now the express pass at fifty dollars that means that % um inside the universal studio there are two kind of queues which are there .
one which you are paying for a normal ticket , you get into joining the huge long queue .
% uh the other express ticket allows you to join the shorter queue .
that means that if you purchase an additional fifty dollars % uh on top of the ticket , you have a chance to join at the shorter queue .
so that it cuts % uh waiting time % uh for the attraction .
so that was the meaning of having the express pass .
right , so if you were to consider of getting the express pass , that would be about hundred and twenty four dollars per person , right ?
so you have about two hundred and forty eight , two hundred forty eight .
plus your hotel will be another % uh two hundred dollars , so about four hundred dollars now .
so inside universal studio % uh what is being included ?
now , in fact universal studio is a theme park and the minute when you purchase this ticket , % uh there ar no limits as on how many times you can go on that particular ride or attraction .
so that means that- that means that if you like the ride so much , you can go the second time even the third time % uh as long as you enjoy it , yah .
yah .
correct .
% uh as soon as the shorter queue % uh available , yah .
so you can see , % um-
okay .
now , % uh let me just go back to the other one which is there .
now coming , i 'm gon na show you the map inside the universal studio .
now , if you are , if your screen is ready , just let me know , so that i can go through it with you one-by-one , like what is % eh there to offer inside the universal studio .
is your screen up there ?
alright , now , if you will take a look carefully onto the lost world which my % uh castle is there .
now , this lost world come % uh with % uh theme park % uh rides , which is required % uh the water ride .
this is the only water rides available here .
% uh the lost world if you ha- have you watch the movie called jurassic park ?
okay , right .
so it 's actually a mock-up of the jurassic park and in a small scale sky .
and % uh do you ride-
% uh no , they are fake dinosaurs .
% uh , yah .
no . of course and then we also do have the % uh if you have watched the movie called the water world ?
now , that they are there inside this % uh small green portion of % uh fireworks here .
% uh that is the show which they are showing live .
% uh part of the show , % um not the full complete show of the water world .
% uh with % uh live exhibit fireworks and % um % uh interactive % uh performance % uh right in front of the guest .
not the original star % ah .
right .
then of course if you like the % uh water rides and there is a water ride you call the repeat adventure , which is quite nice and interesting .
it 's something like a hydraulic wave , that would takes you into the canal which will- % uh let you have a very nice , enjoyable water rides , yah .
yes , of course .
so in case if you plan to take this ride , then you probably have to bring % uh one more extra clothing with you .
right .
so this is % uh the lost world .
then inside there , inside the universal studio , we also have the % um ancient egypt .
if you have catch the movie called the revenge of the mummy ?
% uh this is actually a part of the mock-up for the % uh roller coaster ride .
% uh you know the % um the mine coaster ?
% uh that is the ride which is available inside this ancient egypt .
of course % uh a few things here as well , inside the universal studio food and drinks are not allowed to be in by guest .
yah , you have to purchase their food and drinks inside the universal studio .
so food wise is located near to the jurassic park where the lost world is .
and it 's also located near to ancient egypt .
so those % uh you can get ala carte food % um indian food if you want to .
so it 's available there .
so food court is located at % uh the jurassic park area .
so this is-
well at food court usually the food which is serve there approximately huh , i will say approximately , you have % uh one meal it will cost you approximately around about twelve dollars , singapore dollar .
% eh well , % uh you ca n't compare the street food and the food court inside universal studio .
because the universal studio have % um lots of facilities inside the food court .
like for example , clean environment , air conditioner , yap .
you know , % um you have % uh facilities for young children , huh .
all those things are there .
so of course % uh to have that kind of facilities % uh the price for the food of course is a little bit different , huh .
but if you take food court outside there , probably it will cost five dollars .
at the most fifty per cent more compare to-
yah .
but you ca n't get any food other than the food court inside there .
so you have to take the food there .
right .
now , % uh then the other one is the sci-fi centre .
sci-fi centre in fact % uh has as you can there are so many lines which are there , the blue and the red .
now those are roller coaster track which is % uh for the % uh battlestar galatica .
% uh this is the world fastest and tallest roller coaster ever constructed .
i would say fastest means it complete the cycle within one minute .
yes .
so % uh that is a little bit different and in at the sci-fi centre , we also do have % uh the latest attraction now , which you see just now , the transformer .
it 's actually a three d , i would say three d , four d movie rides inside there , right ?
quite interesting .
no , nothing is required to be paid inside there , except your food and the purchases done by you for your % uh what you call souvenirs , huh .
so % uh all the things are .
the ticket price inclusive of all the rides , unlimited rides inside there .
yah .
so the other part is where you can see the new york .
and new york if you have you- do you know the guy which is % uh producing a lots of % uh sci-fic % uh movies ?
steven spielberg .
yah of course , huh ?
he is very popular in his scientific movie .
now in fact for this person to produce a movie , he in fact do n't create the movie outside- % uh not only outside % uh the premises , but he created the movie inside a theatre itself .
so you can just imagine there , you know , you have % um a strong tornado coming in .
you know he can create a tornado inside the theatre itself to film it .
so you see how wonderful he is % uh and he is been conducted inside the theatre itself .
so it 's a nice place to see and experience .
then % um the other part is % um this part here we call it the hollywood .
that is where the dance are there .
and of course lots of retailer shops are here to sell souvenirs of universal studio singapore .
and the other one which is madagascar .
if you have watch the cartoon movie called madagascar , that % uh is the place whereby they will be performing at the same time .
there are some other rides which are also available there .
then the last part will be the % uh far far away , which is- if you have watch th- cartoon movie called the shrek movie , this is one part the movie which they make into three d 's and it 's a ride inside the % um % uh four d theatre itself .
so this is the whole thing of the % uh universal studio .
and if you were to ask me how much time it 's gon na take , % uh let me say that % eh since you are going on the % uh weekend , you % uh expected to have % uh approximately between nine thirty to five thirty in the whole day .
i would say .
to occupy your time , yah .
the operating hour for universal studio for the rides is from % uh nine thirty the gates will open , it will start from that time .
% eh the last ride will be at seven , that 's it .
% eh seven will be the closing time for the rides .
and after seven , % uh restaurants and retailer shops are still open .
% uh but no more rides are there .
yah .
no , as you can see % uh just now the shuttle service provided from- the free shuttle service % uh usually has a timing .
so you have to catch the timing for the shuttle buses .
the last bus left from % uh resort world universal studio will be at ten p.m. % uh sorry , % uh yah % uh ten , sorry .
% uh ten thirty p.m. yah .
yah .
yah .
so if yo~ if you wan na spend time walking along the retailer shops , you can also that too .
so , this is the time table for the resort world .
if you want catch the free shuttle bus i would say .
alright .
or otherwise the normal train systems % uh they start operating from morning as early as five thirty and will the finish the last train at twelve midnight .
right .
yah .
right .
okay , now % uh so this will be occupying for your full day .
so you of course % uh you can have dinner there and % uh of course you also can do sentosa , if you want to for the song of the sea , right ?
a song in the sea in fact is % uh laser show inside sentosa .
% uh but that again you have to take the train inwards into the beach station .
% uh let me just pull up the sentosa for you .
so that it keep you occupy for the % uh full day .
okay , right .
if you % uh to see on your screen right now , you 'll be able to see the song of the sea .
yes ?
yah , so the song of the sea is located inside the sentosa .
so if you were to take the train again , it 's free because you had already get paid for the admission into the sentosa island .
so that train ride from the waterfront to the beach station , where the song of the sea is located , is free .
so you can take a ride there , but you have to % uh purchase a separate ticket for the song of the sea which is ten dollars per person .
that can actually % uh makes you- % eh that can actually % uh last your night throughout the whole programme .
from the morning all the way until at end of the day , okay ?
right .
so the same day again the minute when you are done , you can take the sentosa express from the beach station all the way back to the vivocity .
or you can also take it back to the resort world , where you can take the % uh free shuttle buses for the tourist , back to your hotel , right ?
okay , so that is % uh for the first day , yah ?
okay .
you like some shopping ?
electronics ?
% uh , yes .
in fact % um most of the peo~ % uh most of the visitor come to singapore , they usually like to shop for electronics .
right , and now % um for sim lim square , it will be the nearest electronic mall to- % uh from your hotel , right ?
from your hotel .
so % um , right .
now it 's walking distance , % uh probably it takes about five to ten minutes towards sim lim square .
and % uh i just show you % uh where it 's located , so that you can easily get around .
now , can you see-
% um % hm , okay .
now you can see from % uh the station here .
% eh can you see smrt link ?
% uh no , not yet is it ?
the screen is not coming up yet , is n't it ?
can you see ?
yah , then you can see that there is % um free shuttle service from little india shoppers , right ?
there 's free shuttle service .
so if you want to take a walk , you can take a walk .
if you want to take the free shuttles , you can take the free shuttles as well .
but it 's % uh not very far away from your hotel , so i would guess probably by walking would be % uh good for you and save some time .
only about five to ten minutes ' walk at the most
right .
now for this sim lim square basically is a six level of electronic mall .
they sell % uh electronics like % uh computer , notebooks % uh printers % uh % uh pda 's , tablets , anything you need with deal with electronics , there is available inside this mall .
and of course % um this mall is also very popular % uh for % uh the vi~ % uh for the tourist .
and if you were to purchase any of the item here in singapore , if you were to purchase % uh not only electronic , but some clothing as well in singapore .
any purchases that you make in singapore above hundred dollars on a single receipt and you would enjoy a tax refund of seven per cent , % uh if you are travelling out of singapore by through changi- this changi international airport .
so if you are travelling out from singapore through % uh coach , then you will not be entitle for the seven per cent rebates .
so if you were to buy any electronics or clothing , you- please ask them to give you a tax refund form .
a tax refund form will be given to you by the retailer , if you purchase a hundred dollars and above .
right ?
changi international airport .
there 's only one international airport here .
so % uh if you were to travel through singapore by air and going out % uh through changi airport , then you will get the tax refund .
then you enjoy the tax rebate by the , yah .
yah , seven per cent .
in fact if you buy a notebook of % uh one thousand dollars , you 'll probably get % uh seven per cent back from there .
then-
yes it 's only available for tourist .
not meant for the local , alright ?
alright , so these are- there 's a list of stalls which are there if you want to take a look .
you can see that % um this is actually a floor plan map of how % uh level one is look like .
you can see that % uh there are so many shops are there even if you were to stand about two or three hours there , i think still not sufficient .
it 's a and next to the sim lim square we also do have the clothing mall , where you can pick-up some shoes or clothes , pants , huh .
% uh your girlfriend which is going with you , % uh she can spend some time there while you spend some time in the electronic mall .
then you meet in-between .
yah .
% uh sim lim square .
% uh next to sim lim square we have the % um albert complex , % uh .
yah .
% uh let me just- yah , albert complex yeh you can see- % uh if you were to see from your screen right now , you 'll find that % uh this is albert complex .
and in fact % uh sim lim square is next to albert complex .
yah .
so % um-
just a minute , i 'll get- okay , i 'm enlarging the map here .
% uh you can see that sim lim square is here .
alright .
now , can you see from here ?
from your map ?
do you see a full map here ?
now selegie fragrance hotel is here .
so if you were to walk across , follow the main road and just walk to % uh sim lim square , the electronic mall .
and albert complex is next to it .
so again , at this area % eh not only that you can do your shopping , but you can also visit some tourist attraction at located at this area where we have the kwam im temple which is one of the popular .
and we also have the hindu temple which is around at the other corner % uh within your walking distance .
so you need not have to travel to much on transportation in fact , by foot is possible also .
right .
so i guess % uh this can fully also occupy your second day .
% uh but if you really want to go to some very unique % uh having some meaning % uh about singapore , the merlion park is one of them that you should not miss .
but % uh % um of course the merlion you have to take the train system down to the merlion park , right ?
yah .
yah .
